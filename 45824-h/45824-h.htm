<h3>THEORY OF THE MEASURE OF TRANSACTIONAL VALUE</h3>


<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Ernest</span> SOLVAY</p>

<p>Would it be possible, in a society constituted as ours is, to
replace the agency of money by another agency which would
have its advantages without its inconveniences, and which
could be considered as theoretically perfect,&mdash;in other words
would it be possible to replace the agency of money by a system
which would be the final expression of possible improvement
in this matter and the definitive point to which social economics
ought necessarily to tend? This is the subject which we
propose to consider.</p>

<p>The paper <i>Social comptabilism and proportionalism</i><a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> which
was the starting point of the Institute of Social Sciences of
Brussels, was necessarily done in a premature fashion, the
subject being regarded from too general a point of view, so as
to be harmful to a true explanation of &laquo;comptabilism&raquo; properly
so called. It laid itself open to criticism and lays itself
open still; it does not satisfy all those who wish to go deeply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>into the question. On these accounts we deem it our duty,
after what the Institute has already published with reference to
it, to return again to the subject, limiting ourselves to purely
monetary and account-keeping grounds, and an exclusively
theoretical explanation of the conception which, connected as
it is with the inductive researches of our fellow workers we
have submitted to their consideration.</p>

<p>In the first place let us examine into the use of money in
society, and to whom it is of use; we will next consider if it is
indispensable.</p>

<p>Money presents itself to us as being an indispensable instrument
for effecting transactions which are not mere acts of
barter, and it presents itself also as having rendered possible,&mdash;and
this is of capital importance as the sequel will show,&mdash;the
registering, the writing down or account-keeping of the
transactions, if one may so say, which barter did not permit.</p>

<p>Money is exclusively of use to those who enter into commercial
transactions. Thus a man who could sufficiently provide
for himself in everything without any such transactions, would
not have to make any use of money; a landed proprietor may
have a considerable fortune and have only a small monetary
need, whilst a merchant whose fortune may be much less will
find himself in a very different situation: for the greater part
of his fortune consisting of merchandise, continually renewed,
and consequently engaged in circulation, his monetary need
will be considerable. It may therefore be said that the need of
money is proportional to the need for commercial transactions.</p>

<p>Beyond what we have just pointed out, has money fulfilled,
or does it fulfil any other purpose? We shall see.</p>

<p>If, from the beginning, we could have had a system allowing
us to exactly register transactions, would money have been
indispensably necessary? In a word, is money in point of fact
the particular element in such transactions which caused the
writing of them down, or, in reality does not its use hide an
agency entirely independent of money? Let us examine this.</p>

<p>But we cannot do so without offering as a necessary
preliminary a few words in explanation of the term &laquo;trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>actions&raquo;,
which we have already used and which will continue
to be employed in this paper to the exclusion of the
word &laquo;exchanges&raquo;.</p>

<p>In our opinion exchange properly speaking,&mdash;true exchange
and free from the alloy of any foreign element whatsoever, has
never been anything but barter; and as soon as the system of
barter was left and that of money entered upon, the exchange
system was rather abandoned for another system quite different,
than that one form of exchange was simply substituted for
another form of exchange. And if we have continued afterwards
to make use of the word &laquo;exchange&raquo; it is due more to
the force of habit than in order to define the actual condition of
things.</p>

<p>What in reality fundamentally characterises barter, is that it
is an exchange, carried out on the spot, of goods immediately
usable by the two parties, each of them giving one usable thing
in order to enter into possession of another; whilst that which
fundamentally characterises the operation of selling and buying,
by means of money, is that it constitutes an exchange of goods
carried out on the spot, of which one form only can be immediately
used by one of the parties, the other party obtaining not a
real thing but an instrument by which he will be able to procure
it. So that the party who has received the money, the seller,
has only thus obtained a <i>power</i> to make subsequently an inverse
operation, that is a purchase where and when it pleases him.
The operation of selling and buying is then nothing less than
the <i>exchange of a thing for a power</i>. But can we still make use
of the word &laquo;exchange&raquo; to define such an operation? We
do not think so, and it is for this reason that we substitute for it
that of &laquo;transaction.&raquo;</p>

<p>The word &laquo;exchange&raquo; has continued to be employed after
having quitted the system of barter to enter upon the system
of buying and selling, by means of money, just as the expression
&laquo;money&raquo; has continued to be used to describe bank-notes,
which are only paper having the power of money, as money is
an instrument having the power of &laquo;things.&raquo; Thus we have
here an example of the general rule, that the evolution of ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and of facts, is always more rapid than that of the words which
represent them.</p>

<p>Our opinion with regard to &laquo;exchange&raquo; will be found all
the more justified since it will be seen later on that the power
conferred by money upon the seller does not exclusively belong
to the monetary system, but that it can be obtained, and
that theoretically it always could be obtained, in quite
another way, without exchanging anything, without having
anything to do with money, by simple entry, registering or
writing down of figures on paper which is not exchanged, but
which remains in one's own hands.</p>

<p>Let us now come back to the question.</p>

<p>We proceed to show that the relative value of things is
independent of the unity of value chosen, and that the transactions
can be registered, written down, abstraction made of
the real, actual value of the material support which has served
to fix this unity.</p>

<p>In a general way and within possibly narrow limits, very
different and variable according as the case may be, given the
existence in actual society of fortunes and desires of all degrees
of importance, one can, in principle, admit that theoretically,
the value <i>v</i> of a thing or of a certain quantity of goods, is
proportional to the average <i>d</i> of the desire to possess it, which
the men demanding it have, either on account of its use, or
from any other reason, multiplied by the number <i>h</i> of these
men and divided by the number <i>o</i> offered of this thing; these
three factors <i>d</i>, <i>h</i> and <i>o</i> not being probably in other respects
determinable with precision.</p>

<p>We shall then have for the formula of value:</p>

<p class="center"><i>v</i> = <i>u</i> &times; <i>dh/o</i>
</p>

<p><i>u</i> being a coefficient of proportionality depending on the unity
of value adopted.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the term <i>dh/o</i> represents in reality the
account of the conditions of the supply and of the demand at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the moment and at the place where the value is determined<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>.
In substituting E, we have a new term expressive of the value:</p>

<p class="center"><i>v</i> = <i>u</i> &times; E.
</p>

<p>The relatively fixed value of the precious metals has made it
possible for the unity of value to be determined on and easily
represented by means of a certain quantity of metal, and the
actual monetary system is the result, the value of all
things having been henceforth expressed by means of
the monetary unity identifying itself with the unity of value
determined on. But it may in consequence be remarked
in looking closely into this, and it is important to do so, that
this result has been reached not because the thing: &laquo;metal
money&raquo;, has made its appearance, but because thanks to it, a
common denominator of the value of things in general has been
employed which did not exist before.</p>

<p>Now, as we shall see, this common denominator does not of
necessity remain invariably tied to the thing, money, or more
generally to any sort of material support which has served to
define it at a given moment. Once fixed it may be considered
independently of this support; becoming thus a permanent
quantity in time and space, taking in consequence the character
of a common measure of the transactional value of things and
being employed as a unity of measure of that value<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>.</p>

<p>In reality this hypothesis could only be made when there was
no such thing as money, and a system of barter exclusively prevailing,
those engaged in making transactions might have said
to themselves. &laquo;Let us choose a common denominator of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>value of things that we may write down our transactions, and
not be any longer obliged to carry on the exchange of usable
things when we do not want them, let us take for example the
value of a kilogram of wheat here at ... to day,
the ... as common denominator and let us calculate
directly the value of all other things by this unity.</p>

<p>&raquo;Evidently every other thing would be worth as many times
this unity as we see men would give kilograms of wheat to
possess it, and thus the numerical value of things would be
easily established.</p>

<p>&raquo;Let us agree further in future always to express the value
of things by this initial value of the kilogram of wheat, <i>a value
which has only existed during the preceding operation, and which
strictly can only have existed for an indefinitely short time, but which
can be considered as absolutely permanent</i>, and apart from any
necessity of occupying ourselves with the variation of value
undergone in time and space by the kilogram of wheat itself.&raquo;</p>

<p>It will result that if <i>v'</i> is the value of a thing at any period and
at any place of which the originally fixed value was <i>v</i>, the
relations will be:</p>

<table border="0" class="tdc" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="the value of a thing at any period">
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td><i>v</i> = <i>u</i> &times; E</td>
  <td></td>
  <td><i>v'</i> = <i>u</i> &times; E</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>whence:</td>
  <td><i>v'/v</i> = E'/E</td>
  <td>and</td>
  <td><i>v'</i> = <i>v</i> &times; E'/E</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>that is the value <i>v</i> of a thing at any time and place is equal to its
initial value simply multiplied by the proportion of the terms
which represent the conditions of the supply and demand at the
two periods under consideration.</p>

<p>Let us note, that, as it should do the formula <i>v'/v</i> = E'/E shows
that the unity is eliminated when the point in question is the
estimate of relative values.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that we do not insist on the practical
possibility of the determination of the coefficients E and E',
which intervene in the preceding formula. We have in effect
said that the factors <i>d</i>, <i>h</i> and <i>o</i>, do not appear to us determinable;
we limit ourselves simply to showing here, the theoretical
possibility of the system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>What is important to remark is that in proceeding, as we have
just pointed out, in all estimates of value and in consequence in
the registration of all transactions, the variation in the value of
the material support, corn, metal, etc. of the unity adopted does
not intervene in any way.</p>

<p>It will be further seen and we would insist on this point, that
the common denominator of the value of things takes in this
system, by the fact of its invariability, the character of a common
measure; that it can in consequence be taken as unity, and
considered in an abstract way.</p>

<p>In fact this unity served once in a certain place and at a given
moment to fix the initial value of things. From that moment it
separates itself from the material thing which served to define it,
which has momentarily represented it, and which has served as
a support in our mind to effect the operations necessary to the
relative fixing of the value of things. These operations made,
it is of little consequence if the value itself of the kilogram of
wheat varies, as is the case with the value of every thing else.
Its initial value was for ever fixed, it can be taken as absolutely
permanent and immutable,&mdash;the fundamental condition which
a unity of measure ought to satisfy.</p>

<p>In like manner original values of all kinds are equally
constant quantities and anyone from among them might be taken
as unity.</p>

<p>In due course the actual values of things alter; varying continually,
and it is the same with the kilogram of wheat or with
any support whatever that has served to define the unity. The
new values will always express themselves numerically by
means of the fixed unity, although that has ceased to have a
material representation. In practice the new numerical values
will be obtained very easily; from the theoretical point of view
they are fixed by means of the formula already given:</p>

<p class="center"><i>v'</i> = <i>v</i> &times; E'/E
</p>

<p>a formula which by the way, shows that if it happened that for
anything at any moment and at any place, the elements <i>d</i>, <i>h</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<i>o</i> took values such that the term (<i>d'</i> &times; <i>h'</i>)/<i>o'</i> should return to a value
equivalent to its initial value (<i>d</i> &times; <i>h</i>)/<i>o</i>, the value of this same
thing would again become identical with its initial value.</p>

<p>This formula shows that the value of things is only relatively
to be taken for it varies ceaselessly, shifting to as great a degree
as supply and demand itself, just as human desire often does,&mdash;it
is only mathematically fixed in time and space, we would
again repeat for an infinitely short period.</p>

<p>This being so it is evident that it becomes possible to put
down in writing all transactions by means of the unity determined
on. And if this writing down of transactions can be made
under a legal form, that is, can be carried out under conditions
which have the effect of conferring on the seller a <i>legal right</i>,
corresponding to what the thing is worth to him who acquires
it, and here we enter into the conception of &laquo;social accountancy&raquo;,
it becomes useless, superfluous and even harmful to
make a material use of the thing representing the unity of the
value adopted.</p>

<p>It is thus that from the beginning, from the very time barter
is abandoned and it is no longer necessary to give a kilogram
of wheat to obtain possession of a thing, that at that very
moment a writing down would confer on the holder of a thing
a right representing a value equivalent to it and permitting him
to effect under the same conditions new transactions.</p>

<p>If things can thus take place, it will be seen how absurd it
becomes to persist in the custom of representing materially a
unity which should be detached from the support which has
served to define it at a given moment, and which no longer
appears as anything but an abstraction permitting in a homogenous
manner the arithmetical representation by figures, of
the value of things, relatively and individually. This abstract
unity ought to be detached from every material tie.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it becomes evident that money does not
in the least constitute the indispensable element for effecting
transactions. And if at the distant period to which the intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>duction
of money goes back it had been possible to tell beforehand
that transactions could be written down in a simple but
legal manner, after having fixed as above indicated the numerical
value of things by the use of a unity essentially invariable,
an enormous error in principle would have been committed if
to the unities admitted as estimates of value had been given, as
is actually the case now, a representation of them in gold and
silver,&mdash;the franc, the mark, the pound sterling.</p>

<p>The usage of money has taken from the unity of value that
character of invariability which it ought necessarily to possess.</p>

<p>This unity being associated in point of fact with a real article
of merchandise, society has been exposed either to want, or to
have too much of the matter thus become the indispensable
element of transactions, to suffer in fact monetary contractions
and dilations, the results of the traffic which necessarily takes
place, results which, for a nation producing the precious
metals, like the United States does, may possibly end in
disaster.</p>

<p>A confusion must necessarily be brought about between the
conventional fixed value attached to pieces of gold and silver
money and the actual variable value of the very matter of those
pieces. The conventional value of a piece of silver corresponds
to the value we have called its initial value, and we have seen it
was possible to preserve to that initial value the character of
absolute permanency. But how can its invariability be assured
if a material support is given to it open to incessant fluctuations
of value resulting from all the speculations to which what ever
can be bought and sold is submitted?</p>

<p>The very fact of the association of the unity of value with an
actual marketable article takes away all stability from the base
of our estimates of the value of things. If the price of any
commodity,&mdash;for example, some article of food or manufacture,&mdash;rises
in comparison with what it was 50 years or a century
ago, it is often asked whether the augmentation is real or
only apparent and due to the diminution in the value of the metal
which supports the unity: it results clearly from what has been
advanced that the variation in the value of metal goes for nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
if, <i>it be well understood that the quantity of money in use is supposed
to remain exactly proportioned to the needs of the transactions</i>. But
when monetary contractions take place, the implement necessary
in transactions is wanting, the value of things in general
falls, for those who are engaged in making transactions offer
their goods at a reduced price to get the monetary implement
without which they cannot effect their operations. It would
evidently be the same if this implement instead of being in gold
or silver, was in wood or paper; and still the same if it was
represented only by comptabilist unities.</p>

<p>Directly it is conceded that man must make transactions then,
if an implement is indispensable to that end, be that implement
paper or comptabilist unities, he will make sacrifices to procure
it and will for this object part with some of his wealth, and
therefore the value of things will in a general way fall. While
if this implement is in excess, that is if there is monetary dilation,
as excess of the implement is of no service to the great bulk
of those who transact business, who only want what is necessary
to effect their transactions and nothing more, it will be found
that the value of things cannot be affected by this as it is in the
preceding case.</p>

<p>We would say that if this implement is in paper, or represented
by accountancy unities, its excess would do no harm,
nor have any effect on the value of things, when in the contrary
case as we have just seen, this value would fall. But if it is in
gold or silver and instead of being stored up in the iron safes of
the banks it circulates amongst those who transact business,
these last will seek to get rid of it, not because as in the preceding
case it is a mere implement of transaction, but as a valuable
metal, and in consequence of withdrawal of this kind the value
of things will be raised.</p>

<p>When we say that the value of things in general would rise in
a case of monetary dilatation occurring in the way we have put it,
and that it would fall in the case of monetary contraction pure
and simple, it is because we are allowing that the supposed want
or excess of money would make itself generally felt amongst
those engaged in transacting business. If it only affected a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
special class of such persons, if gold or silver were only wanting
or only circulated amongst them, it is needless to say that the
rise or fall in prices would only affect the commodities in which
their special property exactly consisted. We believe it right to
attempt to give as logically deduced from the preceding formulas
this note of precision in a rather complex question, which, as
we think, has not always been rightly looked at, and that, in
consequence of the fact that in money, a marketable article of
variable value, is associated with a unity which ought to be
invariable.</p>

<p>In our epoch of exact science and profound insight into
phenomena and things, it is no longer possible to err on the
very basis of a question of an interest so general and so vital
as this relating to the monetary system. The suppression of
such a defective instrument as money and its substitution by a
mere simple writing down of transactions, but legally guaranteed,&mdash;a
system which we have entitled &laquo;Social Comptabilism&raquo;
demands the study of every economist who wishes
progress independently of any dogma, doctrine or party. The
time is at hand in which by the force of circumstances it must
be carried into effect in highly civilized countries. Germany,
almost entirely educated to-day, should have no reason to
oppose its adoption, if she saw clearly the advantages which
social comptabilism presents and the difficulties and inconveniences
which would disappear on its use. It would be a
great error to imagine that any kind of economic revolution is
necessary to establish it. In Belgium M. De Greef<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>, in his
&laquo;<i>Essais sur la monnaie, le cr&eacute;dit et les banques</i>&raquo;, has shown
how simple, logical and profitable it would be to approach it
by rapid strides resting on the fundamental principle of &laquo;social
comptabilism&raquo;,&mdash;the guarantee of property. M. H. Denis<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
in his work on the &laquo;<i>Organisation et le Fonctionnement du service
des ch&egrave;ques et des virements &agrave; la Caisse d'Epargne postale de
l'Empire d'Autriche</i>&raquo;, shows how such comptabilism has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>already approached in what chiefly relates to deferred payments,
in a great country, which although it does not generally lead the
way in progress, seems to have correctly apprehended what
relates to the machinery money masks and wrongly represents.</p>

<p>We shall only add one more observation in justification of
the way we look at the matter, it is that in our country there
is in principle at the present time in the financial organisms
patronised and guaranteed by the State, all that is needed to
realize &laquo;social comptabilism&raquo;. Does not the National Bank
of Belgium, as well as the Bank of France, among our neighbours
to the west, issue bank notes,&mdash;and from our point of
view, these notes represent unities of comptabilist value&mdash;to
all those who offer them sufficient guarantees. In exchange
for a deposit of securities, or for well known signatures, paper
is obtained, notes equivalent to metal money:&mdash;this is already
on the road to social comptabilism.</p>

<p>In place of that, let these banks issue notes, counters&mdash;only
possible to be used once&mdash;or rather bankbooks containing
leaves or fractions of leaves, or squares having a meaning equivalent
to that of notes or counters, or able in some way easily to
realize that meaning, and which would be simply obliterated in
case of transactions accomplished and the working of comptabilism
is fully seen although only at the threshold of the system.</p>

<p>Let the State then enlarge to the utmost degree possible the
power of these banks to issue such notes or cheque books; let
these be authorised to accept mortgages, deposits and all
guarantees from third parties or others, whether directly or
more indirectly by the intervention of other public organisms
appointed to the work, or even analogous private organisms, of
a solvency secured beyond all doubt; let this issue be made
for any amounts, however small; let these establishments be
even authorised to issue notes similar in form, but blank, or
account-books to people without means and only usable on
the understanding that all that results in connection with them
is at the risk and peril of those transacting business, and we
have arrived at comptabilism complete and definitive, even
to the point of suppressing the copper coinage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>It is evident that in this way society as it is at present organised,
can demonetize the precious metals and establish social
comptabilism without in principle having to make any revolution
whatever in its present position, it has only largely to
increase a portion of its machinery, already existing and in full
swing. To sum up, it is a question of a simple change in the
machinery of transactions and all society is interested in the
realization of such a progress purely mechanical and functional,
which moreover has no connection with any doctrine, opinion
or party, and is no new invention whatever.</p>

<p>In conclusion, and at the risk of repeating ourselves, in
order to explain our idea under all its forms, and to render it
accessible to every mind, we think we cannot do better than to
recapitulate it in formulating some articles which set forth in
principle the basis on which legal arrangements could be made
on the hypothesis that the legislative power should determine
suddenly to decree the application of &laquo;social comptabilism&raquo;
such as we have defined it in basing it on the guarantee of
property, on the employ of account books, with debit and
credit entries, and on the use of a stamp or punch to inscribe
or obliterate figures.</p>

<p>The articles recapitulate the essential principles of the reform
from a point of view wholly general, the only one in this notice
we have proposed to examine, leaving for the present absolutely
out of consideration details of application which have to be
studied and which might vary infinitely.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that we by no means believe that a reform
like this can be realized at once, we rather think that it will
come by stages, as is always the case in every fundamental
change relating to any established order of things.</p>

<p>The intermediary phases would probably be the adoption of
the system of comptabilism already in operation in Austria,
principally for defered payments, as it is explained in the work
of M. H. Denis, already cited (it would be only necessary to
add to this system the guarantee of the State, based itself entirely
on the guarantee of individual property, in order to enter
into the plan of &laquo;social comptabilism&raquo;), and on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
a large extension of the issue by the State of paper money
for that which concerns current payments as proposed by
M. De Greef (it would suffice to add the system of stamping as
equivalent to signature, the limitation of the use of paper to a
single operation, and its regular return to the Accountant's
Office, for to make such reforms equally a part of the plan of
&laquo;social comptabilism&raquo;).</p>


<h3>Articles setting forth the principles
of an organic project.</h3>

<p>1.&mdash;From ... the monetary system
shall be replaced by the comptabilist system.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;The National Bank shall become a comptabilistic
establishment, commissioned to deliver to individuals, to
societies, etc., account books, divided into leaves and squares
having a certain significance for the credit, and leaves and
squares having a certain significance for the debit, in which the
signification of the transactional operations effected, and which
at present involve the use of money, shall be stamped<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
respectively to the credit and debit of the account-books of
each of the operators in account unities equivalent to the actual
franc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>3.&mdash;The accountant-general will deliver either blank
account-books, or account-books having a certain sum inscribed
to the credit of the account-book.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;The transactional operations inscribed in a blank
account-book will be effected at the risk and peril of the operators.
Every-one will be able to obtain such an account-book.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;Contrariwise, the transactional operations inscribed in
a credit account-book will be made under the guarantee of the
National Bank, but only in so far as they concur with the sum
inscribed to the credit of that account-book.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;Every-one can obtain credit account-books, for a certain
sum, either in mortgaging some corresponding property in
favour of the Bank, or in offering to it the guarantee of a third
party, who should have agreed to a similar mortgage, or ...</p>

<p>7.&mdash;An account-book out of use or obliterated, or of which
the sum appearing to its credit is exhausted, will be returned to
the accountant-general; should such returner of an account-book
have a balance, then the accountant-general will open an
account in the official books, and enter this balance to that
account.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;Every individual whose account-book balance is to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>credit will be able to obtain credit account-book for a maximum
sum equivalent to this balance, if he offers a corresponding
mortgage either as before stated, on an existing property, or on
property he may acquire by means of the sum thus inscribed to
the credit of his account-book.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What has preceded shows how simple, unobtrusive, passive
is the part played by the accountant-general.</p>

<p>The books containing the figures signifying what transactions
have been effected either to the credit or debit side, with the
figures attached identifying those who have made the transactions,
are remitted to him.</p>

<p>He adds up the credit and debit account and, if there is a
balance, enters it to the account of the possessor of the account-book.
That is all. If he comes across mistakes or errors, he
rectifies them, notably if he discovers that the statements of the
account-books do not agree with the corresponding statements
of the account-books of those whose transactions appear there.</p>

<p>The accountant-general acts as a piece of machinery would
act. He is a recorder of figures, <i>a registrar of balances</i>. If
there are no balances to enter he does not even make a registration,
and is then only a <i>legal witness</i> of transactional operations.
No more is asked of him in order to arrive at the suppression,
pure and simple of the monetary system.</p>

<p>But from the day in which the comptabilist system becomes
legal to the exclusion of the monetary system, from the moment
in which each individual has his personal account introduced
into the registers of the accountant-general, his <i>transactional life</i>
is henceforth, and for ever, represented on the one side by the
mortgages and guarantees that he furnishes in order to obtain
comptabilist unities, on the other hand by the balances of his
account books that the accountant enters successively and indefinitely
to his account. If the whole fortune of each person
were treated in such a manner, and it is this we foresee must
be the legal situation in the definitely social state (having for
sole tax the succession duty, etc., etc.), it is plain that the true
function of the accountant-general would be that of recorder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of the state, of the shifting social position of each person, the
determiner of the diagram of his active, relatively effective life.
Each individual would thus have the stereotype of his effective
social life cast; each social being would have his effective life
formulated, if one may so speak, <i>by relation</i>, always by relations,
nothing but by relations&mdash;to that of all the rest, but in
figures, and yet again, in nothing but figures. And herein is
seen clearly the fundamental error or profound confusion of
those who believe there can be any other thing in the social
problem which occupies us than what has just been stated; of
those who imagine that capital or fortune must be able at
<i>every moment</i>, and not eventually, in the sole end of utilising
the metal for itself, to be represented by its equivalent in gold
or silver; of those who persuade themselves that the words
capital and fortune represent anything else than <i>relative</i> social
power of action or enjoyment which it is sufficient to record,
to make public, purely, simply and legally, as we propose, in
order that it may be absolutely guaranteed to each person.</p>

social</i>) that every-one who makes transactions carries about with him not only his
account book, but also a marker or stamp bearing representative figures or signs,
identifying his personality and by aid of which he inscribes or obliterates the
figures significant of the transactions in the account book of his correspondent.
</p>
<p>
It is needless to add, that instead of marking,&mdash;an operation we have always
put forward the better to show that all account-keeping can be done by simple
inscription or the registration of figures and without any &laquo;exchange&raquo; whatsoever,
not even of bits of paper&mdash;a system could be adopted, for example, consisting of
having on the credit and debit sides of the account-books, leaves of stamps more or
less analogous to postage stamps, credit-stamps which the buyer would detach
from his account-book, and which would be fastened into that of the seller, then
the seller would detach from his account-book corresponding debit stamps to be
fastened to the debit side of that of the buyer. These stamps would carry naturally
besides their signification the same figures or representative signs of the personality
of the maker of the transaction as the marker they would be destined to replace.
</p>
<p>
The comptabilistic system making use of such stamps rather than of marks
would be applied to defered payments as well as to current payments, it could be
thus used in every case.
</p>
<p>
The principle of the account-book consists naturally in the book forming a real
account with debit and credit&mdash;like all accounts in ordinary book keeping,&mdash;in
which is inscribed in a way which would be regarded as valid, having legal force
the sums corresponding to the transactions effected either by being written out at
full length, with the signature, or by marking in figures, and indicating at the same
time the personality of the party making the transaction, or by means of stamps as
we have just seen, or finally by some other way.
</p>
<p>
Directly we leave the principle above mentioned to look at some intermediary
form of its application, a host of combinations offer themselves. The use of stamps
for example would permit doing away with the debit side in the account books.
The buyer in this case detaches, from his account-book, which becomes now only
a credit account book, the stamps corresponding to the extent of the transaction,
and he sticks them in the account book of the seller, which is also only a credit one:
the credit of the seller increases, that of the buyer diminishes, that is all. If the
buyer does not stick his stamps in the account-book of the seller, these stamps
can circulate, they would be analogous to bank notes which have been endorsed by
writing upon them the name of the first party holding them.</p></div></div>




<h3><a name="SOCIAL_COMPTABILISM2" id="SOCIAL_COMPTABILISM2">SOCIAL COMPTABILISM</a><br />

<span class="medium">(COMPLEMENTARY NOTE)</span></h3>


<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Ernest SOLVAY</span></p>

<p>In the last number of these Annals<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>, I explained in a
manner which I consider definitive, the theoretical conception
of comptabilism.</p>

<p>To this point of view it seems to me necessary to add a few
words in order to throw light on certain points which the first
article did not sufficiently bring out.</p>

<p>We have seen what is the use of money and to whom it is
of use, we have considered if it was indispensable. Gold and
silver are not a &laquo;real commodity&raquo; except when they take the
form of useful objects, utensils, works of art, etc., the
possession of which produces enjoyment. Turned into coin,
they lose this character, they become an instrument, an instrument
recognised so far as indispensable for obtaining a real
commodity, be this commodity material or moral, by an
operation which I have designated under the general term of
&laquo;transaction&raquo;. Money is not then a commodity in the true
sense of the word; on the contrary it is generally obtained by
the surrender of a commodity.</p>

<p>It is solely in order to accomplish the &laquo;operation&raquo; of
transaction that money is needed, because this is the method,
the means, the instrument which custom has consecrated; and
if another practicable method, means or instrument were found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>in order to accomplish this operation money would no longer
be indispensable. Now, this is what comptabilism does.</p>

<p>It is essential to note here that the comptabilistic unities,
francs, marks, pounds, etc., would be derived from securities,
and not, as with money by the surrender of commodities, that
in consequence these unities would no longer have a value by
themselves, but simply by the things which they represented.</p>

<p>But apart from that, they could be with held or parted with,
they could be borrowed or lent, with or without interest,
directly from man to man, or by the medium of banking houses,
exactly as in the case of money.</p>

<p>And in fact, if the force of habit required, nothing would
prevent their being called money of account or comptabilistic
money, since apart from what has just been said as to the way
of obtaining them and their nature, nothing would be altered
in the current methods, everything would remain as to day
both in the organisation of business and of society. And all
that might have been said, written or thought until now in an
opposite sense to the fore going considerations should be held
as contrary to the reality of the facts resulting from comptabilism.</p>

<p>The conception of the comptabilistic system is one quite
other than that of the monetary system. There is not the
smallest trace of this second conception in the first; it becomes
necessary to leave entirely the one to understand the other.
In a word the two conceptions mutually exclude each other;
the one is based upon <i>exchange</i>, the other upon <i>accounts</i>, and
the two systems derived rest thus on two essentially different
principles.</p>

<p>The examination of the theoretical side of the comptabilistic
system could not be undertaken through the ideas, nor from
the point of view derived from the monetary system. It is
necessary first of all to accustom oneself to think and speak of
business, finances, etc., abstraction being made of every idea
of money and to persuade oneself that transactions&mdash;and by
transactions I understand every operation, whatever it may
be, which gives rise at present to the use of money or its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
equivalent&mdash;when finally analysed, only modify the ratio of
fortunes. If these ratios could be continuously recognised
and fixed, could be officially registered, money would lose its
use. Indeed, money put in circulation by whatsoever an
operation is only a means of granting to the one who receives
it, the power to acquire subsequently its equivalent, the other
who has given the money having diminished by this much
this power as far as he is concerned.</p>

<p>Now the comptabilistic system in officially registering this
power, acquired on the one hand and diminished on the other,
permits the afore mentioned ratios being fixed, and realises
entirely the part played by money. Therefore it can entirely
be substituted for the monetary system. And let it be said,
in its favour, that the power registered in this system cannot
itself be lessened by the fact of the fluctuations in price of the
metal, as actually now takes place. Moreover, the necessity
which exists at this present moment of surrendering commodities
to procure the monetary instrument indispensable in
transactions, would disappear.</p>

<p>It is evident that it might have been possible <i>theoretically</i> to
pass directly from the regime of barter to the application of the
comptabilistic system, and if one admits that the conception
of this system could have been produced at this far distant
epoch, and have been thus used from the commencement,&mdash;which
in the presence of the laws of evolution of the human
mind, could only be a pure hypothesis&mdash;it must be immediately
granted that the monetary idea could not then have occurred
to anyone&mdash;and even admitting, which is impossible, that it
had occurred all the same to someone, no one would have
dreamt of making use of it, so much in the presence of comptabilism
would the monetary system have seemed barbarous by
its illogical and inconvenient character.</p>

<p>Such are the theoretical considerations which it seems
necessary to insist upon.</p>

<p>But if there is a difficulty in comprehending the question
from its theoretical side, this difficulty disappears if approached
from the practical side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>This is what will be seen on examining the system which
M. Hector Denis has gone to study in Austria and which he
proposes to realise in Belgium.</p>

<p>All the post-offices in the Austrian Empire are in connection
with the Savings Bank, the central establishment of which is in
Vienna and which has become during the last few years a
thoroughly comptabilistic establishment, in this sense, that,&mdash;independent
of its primitive aim, it keeps the accounts of over
thirty thousand who are affiliated and who annually through
this medium do business of which the figures are above a
thousand millions of florins.</p>

<p>The Savings Bank exacts from those persons who wish to
transact business through its medium, a fixed monetary deposit
of 100 florins, without relation therefore to the importance of
the transactions which they can effect; it opens for them an
account and delivers them, upon request, cheque books which
serve to effect the payments which they desire to make. All
this is done by the intervention of any post-office of the Empire.</p>

<p>Each time that a cheque is paid by an affiliated person, the
Central Office at Vienna is advised by post and returns immediately,
also by post, an extract of their account to the two
persons concerned. Each affiliated person's account is thus
kept to date, and this as much for the Central Bank as for the
person affiliated.</p>

<p>Here then are thirty thousand persons who could at a
stretch do entirely without money&mdash;if their mutual relations
were sufficient to permit them to do so for all the necessaries
of life, and this result is obtained merely by the fact that an
official establishment is willing to undertake to keep the banking
account. But it is seen that these thirty thousand persons
are but a select few in the mass of the population, since the
Savings Bank admits them to carry on transactions merely
upon the deposit of 100 florins, thus almost always at the risk
and peril of the transactors, as has always been the case so
far in regard to cheques. And it is evident that if it were
desired to make the system general, it would be necessary to
adopt the principle of comptabilism which would mean that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the transactions were guaranteed by the property of the persons
affiliated.</p>

<p>Here then, as I said, has the Savings Bank of Vienna become
up to a certain point a comptabilistic establishment. I may
add that the dangers that might threaten this institution, as far
as it actually works, spring from its being not entirely comptabilistic,
in so far as it still retains the metallic basis.</p>

<p>The deposits received are not left unproductive, they are
placed in funds, public or otherwise.</p>

<p>Let a political crisis occur which should cause a rush of
withdrawals of these deposits from the Bank and it would be
exposed to the greatest dangers. Solely because the institution
is based upon current ideas and not upon the comptabilistic
system.</p>

<p>In effect, in this latter system, the individual who is affiliated
does not make a deposit of monetary unities having a value in
themselves, he gives as a pledge a commodity, and according
to the value of this commodity he is permitted to make use of
more or less unities.</p>

<p>Here then is the ground on which the institution ought to be
based. Under these conditions deposits are not necessary.
The affiliated person will give a pledge in exchange for his
cheque book. The registers of the Central Savings Bank will
declare that he is permitted to carry on transactions with <i>x</i>
unities, and his cheques will be accepted, as long as he does
not go beyond this figure.</p>

<p>In place of a deposit having a value of its own, there is the
simply writing down, the entry of a right, and the dangers of
the present system would be avoided.</p>

<p>The entry and the writing down constitute the ideal realization
of the comptabilistic system. They lead one to understand
that the transactional unities have only a fictitious value, that they
serve solely to measure the transactional value of things, that
their system is thus dependant on the existence of these things.</p>

<p>Ideally speaking, all the transactions, that is to say the
changes in the fortunes of individuals, may be written down,
may be entered, for example in bank books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>But concerning the practical side, although the entry remains
the ideal conception, it may be that the necessities of human
relations require other methods of a more convenient nature.
This is a side of the question upon which we hope soon to set
forth some solutions, but which can be discussed without the
theoretical side of comptabilism being introduced.</p>

<p>The accumulation and safe keeping of funds, their investment
with the triple guarantee of security, productiveness and easy
and prompt realization are regarded as the fundamental functions
of Savings Banks, and it is in these directions that their
development has especially been accomplished.</p>

<p>The comparative studies on these institutions, such as the
works of Rostrand and the fine account of Messrs Hamande and
Burny testify to the increasing ingenuity of the means of
drawing out and gathering up savings, and of the great expansion
Savings Banks well conducted can give to divers forms of
credit, and will finally be obliged to give them.</p>

<p>But such is the flexibility of this institution that in carrying
the spirit of reform into the means of assuring to the depositor
the most prompt and convenient disposal of his savings, there
ought, in order to apply it to his payments, to be accomplished
in the Savings Bank, an evolution equally fecund in a new
direction.</p>

<p>A savings bank like that of Vienna having at its command the
powerful lever of the postal service, combining in a few years
with singular ability, the centralization of the accounts of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
depositors with the post office functions,&mdash;at once receptive
and distributive, centripetal and centrifugal, cannot fail to
appear one of the most ingenious, stable and perfect organs of
modern circulation.</p>

<p>There is no need to discover in this functional evolution the
realisation of any new principle&mdash;undeniable bonds of filiation
attach it manifestly to the Bank of Amsterdam, whose system of
clearing accounts Adam Smith has so admirably described, and
in a still more distant past to the Bank of Venice, which, more
perhaps than the Bank of St-George, served as a type to the
Bank of Amsterdam; only like the most advanced modern institutions
of credit and settling up, it has, over the primitive
institutions, the advantage of perfections of means, of rapidity,
and of an ever-growing importance in its operations, and of an
ever increasing economy of money;&mdash;it has as its own peculiar
features conditions of special expansion, valuable means of
control and specially a capacity of adaptation to a system of
credit institutions which can make it one of the instruments
of the transformation of the monetary system.</p>

<p>The Austrian Imperial Government in carrying out the
reforms which are the subject of this paper does not directly
pursue the solution of the monetary problem, but is primarily
occupied with the financial interest of the Savings Bank. As
its able secretary, M. Tobisch, has explained, the law of
May 28<sup>th</sup> 1882, of which the text is given further on, in organising
the Postal Savings Bank, caused no doubt a considerable
number of deposits to be made, but their average importance
was so feeble and they involved such general expenses,
that the cost almost completely absorbed the results of the
investments. In order to distribute these general expenses
over a greater mass of monies and to realise a larger clear
profit, that is to cause more considerable deposits to be made
by especially interesting tradesmen and working-men to have
recourse to the medium of the Savings Bank, a notice of the
Minister of Commerce of Oct. 29 1883, authorised the depositors
of over 100 florins to draw cheques on the Central Office
at Vienna. Originally the depositor remained the holder of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
his account-book, but from Dec. 1 1886, the deposit of all
such books at the Central Office in Vienna became obligatory
for those who wished to take advantage of the cheque service.
The institution of this service had a considerable influence on
the progress of the amount of deposits; before the reform in
1883 the total deposits amounted to 8,176,889 florins, a year
after in 1884, they reached 56,586,461 florins, of which
46,223,539 was connected with the cheque service.</p>

<p>The natural corollary of the centralisation at Vienna of the
accounts of all those who adhered to the cheque-service was
the organisation of the service of clearing accounts, for the
more the number of its adherents increased, the more frequently
it happened that one depositor drew a cheque in favour
of another depositor. The cheque, up till then payable in
specie, became a clearing cheque realisable by a simple transfer
in writing. This complimentary service which is destined to
become the principal one, was instituted Sept. 1 1884.</p>

<p>The Austrian institution is only at present an element in the
vast modern system of credit and the balancing of accounts
and no one is ignorant that the system entirely rests on metallic
money, as Stanley Jevons, Francis A. Walker and Macleod
have elsewhere clearly shown. Macleod makes the striking
comparison of modern circulation to the movement of a peg
top which spins round on a very fine metallic point.</p>

<p>The Postal Savings Bank, as it is organised and works, has
not yet any kind of purpose of freeing circulation from its
metallic basis, but like all other credit institutions, it contributes
to this end by economising more and more the use of
money; with extraordinary powers of expansion, it enables an
ever increasing number of respectable persons, associations or
bodies, to effect all their payments without the least risk,
almost without loss of time and without having to keep any
metallic money in their possession. And if one tries to conceive
the future ideal evolution of an instrument so flexible as
the Savings Bank, one may expect as I shall attempt to show
in subsequent papers, that in combining its circulatory function
with its function of investment it will be led into concurrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
with the radical transformation sought by M. Solvay in the
definitive elimination of the metallic instrument.</p>

<p>The sources from which the materials of this account have
been drawn, are the laws, regulations and instructions of which
the translation is appended, the statistics of the cheque and
clearing service in the last official report (Zw&ouml;lfter Rechenschaftsbericht
des postsparcassen Amtes) the remarkable studies of
M. Tobisch, secretary of the Savings Bank, and finally direct
observation. Guided by one of the most enlightened officials
of the Savings Bank, Inspector L. Kotschy, I have been able to
penetrate into the inner life of this admirable institution. The
Vienna Central Postal Bank occupies the old palace of the University;
there, distributed in its antique halls, a population of
1,300 employ&eacute;s, among them 150 ladies, working after a skilfully
organised plan, pursue silently now for thirteen years, with
inflexible method, an experiment of very great interest for science
and for the economic life of societies. Bound by invisible
threads to more than four thousand secondary organs:&mdash;the
post offices, which plunge directly into the torrent of the
exchanges,&mdash;the Central Office records each day with extraordinary
precision the minutest changes that the ever increasing
number of its adherents accomplish in the social movement of
wealth.</p>

<p>All the operations of which it thus fixes the traces arrange
themselves into two great classes which recur as the two
essential aspects of the rhythmic movement of a central organ of
circulation; one joins in the formation of the property of every
adherent of the system, in the constitution of his credit at the
Central Bank; the other leads to different modes of disposing
of his property and to the formation of his debit.</p>

<p>The services of cheques and account-clearing<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> of the
Austrian Savings Bank enable on the one hand every person to
make, under conditions fixed by law, in any Post Office in the
Austrian Empire, payments on account, or to the profit of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>those who participate in the service; on the other and they
enable every adherent to assign by means of a payment cheque,
a part of his property to anyone, physically and morally, or by
means of a clearance cheque to cause the transfer to be made
to the account of another participator in the service.</p>

<p>The Austrian terminology bristles with difficulties, the name
of <i>cheque verkehr</i> is here given to the first of these services,
<i>circulation of payment cheques</i> resulting in the end in the use of
metallic money, and to the second service, the name of <i>clearing
verkehr</i>, circulation of <i>clearing cheques</i>, which resolves itself, as
far as the Savings Bank is concerned, into the transference
from one account to another, in the substitution of one creditor
for another.</p>

<p>The cheque service may exclusively be adhered to, or the
cheque and <i>clearing</i> service.</p>

<p>For affiliation to the cheque service it is necessary to request
the Office of the Postal Savings Bank in Vienna to open an
account, to send a cheque book and a book of <i>certificates of
receipts and deposits</i>, of which we are now about to speak. The
cheque book costs 1 florin 50 kreutzers, the certificates of
deposit 1 kreutzer a piece.</p>

<p>The Post Office can refuse the request without having to give
any reason. If an account is opened to the grantee, he receives
cheque books and certificates, but he is bound within a month
to effect a deposit of 100 florins as security. Neither the law
nor the regulations fix any maximum of deposit. The minimum
of 100 florins will remain in the hands of the administration,
without the person entitled to it being able to dispose of it as
long as he has an account open in the Post Office. The adhesion
to the <i>clearing</i> circulation is at once requested by the Post
Office, of adherents to the cheque service.</p>

<p>The number of adherents to the cheque service is not identical
with that of adherents to the service of <i>clearing</i>. For the thirteen
years that these services have been instituted the first has
always taken precedence of the second, but the divergence
which exists between the two numbers is being reduced and the
number of adherents to the <i>clearing</i> service tends to blend and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
will finally blend with the adherents to the cheque service.</p>

<p>The geographical distribution of those who have accounts in
the two services is of much interest. In 1895, out of 28,363 adherents
to the cheque service there were 27,820 in Austria, 353 in
Hungary, and 190 abroad,&mdash;163 in the German Empire, 5 in
England, 1 in France, 3 in Holland, 5 in Italy, 3 in Switzerland,
2 in Belgium&mdash;an interesting fact.</p>

<p>The twelfth report: <i>Zw&ouml;lfter Rechenschaftsbericht
des postsparcassen Amtes</i>, insists on the important number of Hungarian
commercial firms, affiliated to the Austrian Bank, all of whom
have an account open in the Post Office Savings Bank instituted
in 1887 at Budapest; it announces the approaching inauguration
of a direct and regular service of account-keeping
between the two Banks, a service to which the traders in both
countries attach great importance. It will mark a new phase
in the evolution of the institution; and form as it were the
preface to its internationalisation.</p>

<p>It is curious to note that out of 543 residing in Hungary and
abroad who have cheque accounts, there are 434 who are
affiliated to the <i>Clearing</i> at Vienna, that is 79.9%, a proportion
very much larger than is seen in all those in the various
Austrian provinces.</p>

<p>The number of those having accounts has successively been:</p>

<p>From the above it is seen that the proportion per cent of the
number of adherents to the service of clearing rises gradually
in the later years;&mdash;after having from 1890 to 1893 been nearly
uniformly from 69 to 70%, it rises in 1895 to 73.2%.</p>

<p>The classification of the adherents from the point of view of
conditions and profession reveals the elasticity peculiar to such
an institution. Advocates, notaries, doctors, even professors
appear in great numbers. Manufacturers and traders united
represent nevertheless more than half the total number of
members; 339 bankers and money-changers, 362 associations
for savings and loans, 220 private savings banks, 1,490 associations
or corporations,&mdash;public establishments of which
185 were communes and administrative bodies,&mdash;271 benevolent
associations, funds, establishments and foundations,
175 agricultural and forestal associations and 175 religious
associations, 266 assurance societies, and 204 journals or
periodicals serving as media for the Savings Bank. The administration
of the State forests and domains have recourse to the
Savings Bank in order to bank the produce of the forestal sales,
and the administration of taxes is now experimenting as to its
intervention for the getting in of duties. This institution thus
presents a marvellous flexibility, invading by degrees the whole
domain of exchange and enveloping one by one all the organs
of the collective life.</p>

<p>Let us first explain the modes of operating payments to the
profit of every member affiliated to the cheque and clearing service.
In the first of these modes, the instrument employed is
the <i>certificate or attestation of receipt and of deposit</i> (<i>empfang erlag
scheine</i>). (Fig. 1.)</p>

<p>Books containing blank certificates are issued by the Central
Office at the low price of a kreutzer the piece, to every person
adhering to the cheque and clearing services; these are books of
10, 20, 50 and 100 pieces, and to meet the needs of various
holders they are drawn up either in German or in some other of
the tongues spoken in the Empire. All these certificates bear the
number of the account to the operations of which they are destined
and carry the name and the address of the account holder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Each of the certificates presents three parts which are separated
one from the other in the course of the operation: the first,
the counterfoil, remains attached to the book and in the hands
of the holder of the account; of the two others, one, the attestation
of the payment, has to be returned by the Post Office
receiver to the person who makes the payment; the third the
certificate of the deposit has to be transmitted to the Central
Office at Vienna, which returns it to the holder of the account.
To make a payment it is necessary to fill in the certificate of
receipt and the certificate of deposit, and to present them at a
Post Office with the sum to be paid into the holder's account.
The receiver of the Post Office will bank the sum, and will sign
the receipt, imprinting on it the stamp of the office, and will
remit it to the person making the payment; he will then detach
the certificate of the deposit and will send it to the Central
office at Vienna with the daily account of his operations. The
central administration will immediately credit the person in
whose favour the payment is made, in the account that it has
opened for him, and it will then transmit to him the deposit
certificate with an extract of his account.</p>

<p>Such is the series of operations which result from <i>empfang
erlag schein</i>.</p>

<p>Suppose for example that the holder of an account is a
merchant who has furnished supplies to a customer in the
provinces to the amount of a hundred florins, net. He fills up
a leaf of the account book, bearing a certain number, on which
he indicates the amount payable, and which payment is to be
placed to his account; he sends this leaf to his customer,
keeping the counterfoil with the customer's name written on
it: the customer forwards the leaf to the Post Office where he
lives with the sum due: the postal receiver separates from the
leaf the certificate of receipt (<i>empfang schein</i>), which he signs
and returns to the customer, he sends the certificate of
deposit to the Central Office at Vienna, where the sum is
carried to the account of the merchant. After which the
deposit certificate bearing the name of the person making
the payment is forwarded to the merchant with an extract
from his current account, enabling him thus to exercise
strict control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Deposits can be made by the intermediary of rural postmen
to the extent of 500 florins. In this case the receipt and deposit
certificates must be remitted to them with the sum; a provisional
receipt is given which is replaced at the next round by
the official receipt of the district post-office.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to show the importance to which this
mode of arranging deposits has now attained.</p>

<p>There is at the Central Office at Vienna a printing office which
permanently employs 16 workmen, exclusively engaged in printing
cheques and certificates of receipts and deposits. Six million
of the latter kind of certificates are now annually printed
and the number of them printed since the setting up of this
system in 1883 amounts to 107 millions. An office for the
verification and control of the printed matter is connected with
this workshop. As to the amount of payments made through
these certificates to the accounts of holders the 12<sup>th</sup> Report
enables us to give the statistics.</p>

<p>At the opening of the year 1883 the sums paid into the funds
of the account holders, by means of the <i>Empfang erlag schein</i>
amounted to 322,284 florins.</p>

<p>They rose successively:</p>

<p>The annual growth has been during the later years about 70 to
80 millions of florins. It moves at a regular pace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>I have shown by the example above how by aid of the <i>empfang
erlag scheine</i>, the trader can by means of his responsible agent,
the Savings Bank, receive at once the amounts of his invoices,
without the money passing through his own hands. Numerous
other applications of the system are before us: commercial
travellers can deposit to the account of their employers, the
sums they have collected in their rounds; they can even add at
the back of the certificate such helpful notes as they think necessary;
the commercial firm which employs them being regularly
and immediately informed of payments by account extracts and
the certificates of deposit being successively forwarded to the
firm by the Central Office at Vienna.</p>

<p>Associations of every kind having accounts at the Savings
Bank can by the same means gather subscriptions from the
members: it is enough to send their members <i>certificates of
receipt and deposit</i>; each one makes his payment at the neighbouring
post office; the associations receiving, as the merchants,
extracts of their accounts.</p>

<p>Assurance societies can in like manner, effect the payment
of their insurers' premiums without any formality beyond that
of sending to these insurers the <i>empfang erlag scheine</i>. And in
like manner subscriptions to journals and all kinds of periodical
payments can be received.</p>


<h3><i>Secondly.</i></h3>

<p>Post Office orders issued to the benefit of any person affiliated
to the cheque-service can, at his request be placed to the
credit of his account. He gives to this end, on forms required
by the regulations, an authorisation at his district post office.
On its side the Central Office of the Savings Bank puts itself
in relation with the post office. Ingenious combinations which
are indicated in the instructions reproduced in the appendix to
this paper, cause the order to be transmitted to the Money
Order Office of the Viennese Post Office, which in paying the
amount to the Central Office of the Savings Bank will at the
game time inform of this transmission, the person in whose
favour the order is made out.</p>

<p>The Post Office Orders only take a very secondary position
in the accounts of the <i>cheque</i> and <i>clearing</i> service.</p>

<p>The last and assuredly the most ingenious of the application
of the system is being made at this very time in the payment
of taxes.</p>

<p>The <i>certificate of the payment of taxes (steuer Einzahlungs-schein)</i>
is nothing but a special form of <i>empfang erlag schein</i>;
the Savings Bank proceeds experimentally by the trial of this
mode of collecting the taxes in the province of Lower Austria.</p>

<p>The document, which costs 5 kreutzers, is divided into
three parts: the <i>Empfang schein</i>, the <i>Erlag schein</i>, the
<i>Treasury acknowledgement: Amtliche best&auml;tigung</i> (confirmation
and official attestation). (Fig. II.)</p>

<p>The tax payer pays at the Post Office the amount of his tax
which must be paid to the account of the central administration
of taxes at Vienna; the document bears the account number
of this Receipt Office of Taxation. The attestation of this
payment of the tax-payer is signed by the postal employ&eacute; and
bears the stamp of his post office.</p>

<p>The remainder of the document is detached from the tax
receipt and presents at first the <i>erlag schein</i>; it is the authentication
of the deposit paid to the cashier of the administration
of finances and which is sent by an employ&eacute; of the Central Post
Office at Vienna. It bears the name, the profession, the
address of the tax-payer, the amount of the payment made by
him, and shows what is the nature of the taxes received and
the number of the account at the ministry of finances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>The other part of the document is the attestation by the
ministry of finances itself of the payment made to its account;
this <i>amtliche best&auml;tigung</i> will be detached and sent to the tax-payer:
he will thus possess in the end a double authentication.
It may be easily imagined how a tax-payer who is an adherent
of the clearing service can pay his tax by a simple transfer of
accounts, the ministry of finances having itself an account
open at the Savings Bank.</p>

<p>If the various modes which concur to the formation of the
property of the account holders in the Central Office at Vienna
are considered as a whole the total amount of deposits has
successively been:</p>

<p>In fixing the proportional relations per cent of all the statistical
data here brought together we see that the factors which
concur to form the credit of the double service of cheques and
of clearing, the payments made by way of <i>empfang erlag schein</i>
represent in 1895, 65%, and the transfers by writing about
35%, while the total amount of the banking of post office
orders, of interest in the public funds and of bills does not come
to more than 3% of the whole.</p>

<p>The second class of operations of the cheque and clearing
service of the Austrian Postal Savings Bank embraces the different
modes of disposing of the property of the depositors who
share in the service. The cheque is in a general way the
instrument to which they recur under its two fundamental forms
of cheques of payment and cheques of clearing, according as the
amount is to be paid in cash or to be transferred to the account
of another participant in the clearing service. The cheque
books remitted to holders serve the double purpose; it has not
been found necessary to print distinct documents, nor even to
give to these two classes of cheques different colours.</p>

<p>Cheque books containing fifty pieces are remitted to participants
by the Central Office at the charge of 1 florin 50 kreutzers;
this sum means 50 kreutzers, expense of paper and
printing and 1 florin stamp duty. They are printed on the
premises of the Central Office as are the attestations of receipts
and deposits. About 2,500,000 of them are now annually
reproduced and more than 23,000,000 of cheques have been
issued since the official presses were first set up at Vienna.
They are prepared either in German, or in any other language
spoken in the Empire. Before sending them to the holders of
an account the Office prints on each of these vouchers the
number of the account for which they are to be used, as well
as the name and address of the holder. (Fig. III.)</p>

<p>Expressed in ordinary terms, the cheque states, that the
Savings Bank will pay, on the voucher being forwarded, the
sum of which the amount in florins has been written out in full.
It bears the signature of the person drawing it. To avoid
frauds in the statement of the sums to be paid, the Savings
Bank has adopted moreover an arrangement so ingenious and
sure that up to the present time no fraud has been noted.</p>

<p>The cheque bears to the right four series of figures going
from 1 to 9. The first set corresponds to thousands, the
second to hundreds, the third to tens, the fourth to units; the
four series united together can express the sum of 9,999 florins,
beyond which no cheque can be drawn, so that if this part
of the document is left intact, the amount of the cheque will
be 9,999 florins, provided always that the written statement
agrees with the series of figures. If a lower figure is stated,
then the number of the thousands, hundreds, tens exceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the amount desired must be cut off with a pair of scissors.
Suppose for example the cheque is to be for 782 florins; the
column of the thousands is to be cut off, figures 8 and 9 in the
columns of the hundreds, the last figure in that of the tens and
the last seven in the column of units. It is evident that by
this ingenious method of control, it will never be possible to
raise the amount of the cheque; it will be of no use to alter
the written statement of the amount in order to augment it, for
it will never be possible to make a corresponding alteration in
the arrangement of the figures to the right; by this process of
cutting off, the cheque can only be reduced in value but never
augmented. And if the agreement between the written
figures and the combination of the figures resulting from this
way of cutting them out is not perfectly exact, the Central
Office at Vienna rejects the voucher as possibly fraudulent, at
any rate erroneous.</p>


<h3><i>Firstly.</i> (<i>Cassa-checks.</i>)</h3>

<p>The cheque (of payment) can be payable to bearer at the
Postal Savings Bank at Vienna. In this case it is delivered
to the person who ought to receive the amount without the
drawer having to transmit it to him. This party can either
bank it himself immediately at the Post Office Bank at Vienna,
or put it in circulation: this circulation is authorised for fourteen
days, but the voucher cannot carry any endorsement.
The cheque will be paid by the Office up to the time that the
credit account of the drawer is sufficient to meet it.</p>

<p>If the cheque has been delivered to a person affiliated to the
postal-service of cheques and clearing, he can have the
amount put to his credit instead of receiving it in cash.</p>


<h3><i>Secondly.</i> (<i>Zahlungsanweisungen des postsparcassen-Amtes.</i>)</h3>

<p>The customer of the Postal Savings Bank has the right to
cause the amount of the cheque to be paid into the hands of a
particular person in any one of the Post Offices; in this case
he writes on the back of the cheque the address of the person
for whom he intends it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figure III.</span></p></div>
<img src="images/illus-047.png" width="700" height="371" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This cheque will be sent by him to the Central Office at
Vienna. There are special envelopes for the transmission of
these advices which are sold by the Office to the possessors
of cheque books. The Central Office will immediately transmit
to the person designated an assignment of payment and the
cheque will be paid to him on his returning this assignment,
signed by him as a receipt. He will detach from it, in
order to preserve it, a portion on which is noted the amount
of the sum he has received, who the holder of the account
is, the said portion bearing also the stamp of the Postal
Office at Vienna.</p>

<p>A notice to the post office where it is payable will have
been sent at the same time, giving authority to pay the
cheque. (Fig. IV.)</p>

<p>Everyday 4,000 to 5,000 of these authorisations to pay
cheques are issued. Ladies write out these authorisations
by means of type-writing machines: their fingers work the
machine with astounding rapidity. According to the data
given me each of them prints every day 400 to 500 assignments
of payment to the persons designated and authorisations to
the post-offices to pay; and the hours of work averaging
seven, they write about one a minute.</p>


<h3><i>Thirdly. (Postanweisungen.)</i></h3>

<p>The cheque can be drawn in favour of a person living in
Hungary or a foreign country. It is enough that on the
back is noted:&mdash;&laquo;for the issue of a post office order
in favour of N ...&raquo;, and that it is signed. The Central
Office at Vienna will send immediately a post office order
of corresponding import. The telegraphic order can even
be used.</p>

<p>Statistics distinguish these three categories of cheques
and enable us to follow their movement.</p>

stocks to be bought. The rights acquired by the Post Office
will either be sent on to the purchaser of the stocks, or at his

<p>The Postal Savings Bank pays in the same way on account
of the adherents of the cheque and clearing service, bills, signed
bonds, accounts admitted and approved. Bills of exchange are
settled at the Postal Office at Vienna. In order to realize their
payment, the holder of an account draws a cheque for the
amount of the bill and writes on the back: <i>for payment of the
bill herein refered to</i>. He indicates the date of its falling due
and puts his signature below these remarks. This cheque is
sent to the Postal Office at Vienna before the bill falls due. It
can be addressed also to the possessor of the bill, who will present
it at the date it is due to the Postal pay Office with at the
same time his claim. If the possessor of the bill is himself
affiliated to the cheque service he can have the bill put to the
credit of his account.</p>

<h3><i>Sixthly.</i></h3>

<p>Here the system presents to us its highest degree of interest:
the possessors of account books, adherents of the clearing
service, can discharge their debts one to the other by the transfer
of accounts. It is sufficient to write at the back of the
cheque: to be carried to the credit of account N<sup>o</sup> ..., with the
name of the holder of the account and his address. In this
case the amount of the cheque is placed to the debit of the
person who issued it and to the credit of the person in whose
favour it is drawn.</p>

<p>The two holders of accounts at the Savings Bank are immediately
informed of this transfer by the sending of the extract of
their accounts.</p>

<p>The cheques which have this destination are properly speaking
clearing cheques not intended to be paid in species; but it
may happen that a cheque destined for a member, adherent to
the clearing service has in an exceptional case to be paid in
money; the person who has issued it will in that case have to
make a note at the back of the document: <i>Outside the clearing
circulation</i>.</p>

<p>The statistics show the growing importance of <i>clearing
cheques</i>.</p>

<p>It will be seen that in the last ten years, the amount has
nearly quintupled. The pace of the movement is here more
rapid than in cheques payable in cash.</p>

<p>The proportional relations of all the modes of disposing of
the credit of the adherents of the cheques and <i>clearing</i> service
show that in 1895 on a total of liquidations or payments of
1,484,251,488 florins, 32% were occasioned by transfers of
accounts, 32% by cheques to bearer (<i>cassa-checks</i>), 35% by
cheques to appointed persons, and the remainder by the other
modes indicated.</p>

<p>All this formidable account keeping is done strictly day by
day. Three hundred employ&eacute;s are working at it constantly.
Special employ&eacute;s who have acquired an extraordinary ability,
verify the signatures on each occasion. The type signatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
are classed alphabetically. Current-accounts are drawn up
on loose sheets and not in books: this is considered a real
progress for books are soon in tatters. On each occasion
an extract of the account is sent to the party interested: every
transfer entails the sending extracts to both parties interested.
Envelopes with their names and addresses printed are classified
in pigeon holes so as to be easily found. I join to this explanation
some extracts from typical accounts. One shows a
banking made by a post office, the other a transfer made
between adherents to the <i>clearing</i> system. (Fig. V.)</p>

<p>The centralisation of all this vast account-keeping at the
Central Office of the Savings Bank at Vienna is the basis of
the system, the pledge of the regularity of the service and of
the certainty of the control. Notwithstanding the inevitable
complexity of operations and accounts, this complexity does
not entail any really prejudicial delays<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>. The increasing
figure of the operations is a proof of the growing favour of the
public and is a testimony to the usefulness of the institution
beyond all argument. The coefficient of error has been very
slight and fraud has not been as yet able to succeed in causing
trouble in the working of this admirable machinery of circulation.</p>

<p>The Central Office is put every day in relation with 4,000 post
offices, which transmit to it packets containing the <i>empfang erlag
schein</i>, the claims and all the documents which have been
brought them. The unfastening of this immense correspondence
is simplified by machinery. All these documents are
enclosed in large envelopes of uniform dimensions so that they
can be opened by packets, in cutting off their edges by means of
large knives working mechanically. (Fig. VI.)</p>

<p>The Postal Office of Vienna prepares annually the list of all
the possessors of cheque books who are adherents to the clearing
service; this list is printed and can be obtained by subscribers
with the supplements published at irregular intervals for
one florin a year.</p>

<p>This list is the expression as it were, of a conscious agreement
of wills on a more and more extended scale in a common work
of reciprocity.</p>

<p>The all round figure which sums up for the service during
1895, the total amount of operations relating to the credit and
debit of holders of accounts in the Postal Savings Bank of
Vienna is 2,970,170,049 florins. It will be interesting to learn
what have been the expenses which have arisen from such a
vast amount of business.</p>

<p>The account of the financial administration of the service
of cheques and <i>clearing</i> makes the administrative expenses
899,356 florins, that is three-hundredths of a florin, for every
100 florins of business<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>. The average business done for
each possessor of a cheque book is 100,000 florins, and the
average charges of the service per person have been about
30 florins.</p>

<p>Going back ten years it is seen that when in 1886 the amount
reached 944,997,612 florins, the total expense was 620,247 florins,
or six-hundredths of a florin for every 100 florins of business
done. The operations averaged about 90,000 florins to
each holder of a cheque book and the charges 44 florins each
person. The law, in accordance with which the general
expenses are relatively reduced by the increase in the figure of
business done, receives here a fresh verification.</p>

<p>Such is the summary explanation of the organisation and
working of the cheque and clearing system instituted thirteen
years ago at the Postal Savings Bank of Vienna.</p>

<p>It is based on the centralisation at Vienna of the accounts of
depositors holding cheque books and on the almost absolute
perfectness of the regularity and precision with which all those
interested are every time fully informed of their position of the
Central Bank, and, in consequence, of the extent of the credit
they have at their command. This institution implies the free
adhesion under conditions fixed by law of all the depositors at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>the Savings Bank and the right of each to withdraw as he thinks
proper. The institution therefore works on the ground of stipulated
contract, but its elasticity is seen in the perpetually
widening extension of its operations and its making way in
every class of society and in every one of the professions.</p>

<p>Its realization under the international form, for we give this
character to an agreement between the Savings Banks of Austria
and Hungary, is only a question of time, and the new experiment
will prepare the way for a new enlargement of the system.</p>

<p>The basis of the institution is monetary, it differs in this respect
in no way from all the other modern institutions of credit
and of balancing one account against the other; but the saving
of money is ever on the increase. Within the monetary circulation
is developed a circulation which if it remains still subordinate
to the monetary circulation is not inevitably enchained to it.
Our collective effort tends to break for ever this bond of subordination.
The papers which will follow will be a contribution
to that work.</p>

of the 19<sup>th</sup> of November 1897. (R. G. Bl. N<sup>o</sup> 133.)</i></p></div>

<p>With the consent of the two Houses of the Imperial Council
I will to order as follow:</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 1.</span></h4>

<p>Under State administration and guarantee there will be
founded at Vienna a State Savings Bank, under the control
of the Minister of Commerce and belonging to the jurisdiction
of the Postal Administration, with the title &laquo;Post Office
Savings Bank&raquo;.</p>

<p>The sphere of activity, the organisation and the civil service
of the Post Office Savings Bank will be fixed by means of
ordinances.</p>

<p>Post Offices in the kingdom and lands represented in the
Imperial Council will be appointed by the Minister of Commerce
to serve as receiving offices of the Post Office Savings
Bank.</p>

<p>To the Post Office Savings Bank will belong the management
and execution of the business assigned to it by this
law; in which business it will represent before the public the
administration of the State.</p>

<p>To give advice as well as to make proposals in the business
relating to the Postal Savings Banks, a special Council will
be constituted.</p>

<p>Regulations as to the composition of this special Council
as well as the determination of its special sphere of action
will follow by way of ordinance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 2.</span></h4>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank will receive savings deposits
paid into the Post Offices, and by the agency of the Post
Offices will pay back the deposits when reclaimed.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 3.</span></h4>

<p>All deposits in excess of the current needs of the Post
Office Savings Bank are to be profitably invested.</p>

<p>Such profitable investments of the savings-deposits will
be made by the purchase of the Austrian Consolidated Bonds
bearing interest.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 4.</span></h4>

<p>From the profit of the invested deposits is to be defrayed
the interests on the deposits, as well as the whole expenses,
administrative or otherwise.</p>

<p>As long as the profit of the funded capital of the deposits
is not sufficient to pay the interest of the savings-deposits
and to cover the expenses of the administration, the deficit as
well as the costs of the establishment of the institution will
be advanced by the State as a charge on the Postal Budget.</p>

<p>These advances are to be restored without interest, to the
Postal Budget, out of the surplus appearing at the close of
the administrative year.</p>

<p>The surplus remaining over after the entire liquidation of the
above named advances is to be employed in the formation of
a reserve fund.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 5<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a>.</span></h4>

<p>The receiving office (Post Office) in which a first deposit is
made, gives to the party who makes the deposit, a deposit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>book, in which each amount paid in, each amount paid back
and the interest added to the capital is to be entered. Each
subsequent payment can be made in any receiving office (Post
Office), the amount being entered in the deposit book.</p>

<p>That person is to be considered the depositor on whose
behalf the deposit is made.</p>

<p>The deposit-book is to be delivered gratuitously and is
stamp free.</p>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank will open an account for
each depositor.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 6<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a>.</span></h4>

<p>The deposit-book is issued in the name of the depositor and
is to contain the notes necessary in forming a judgement of his
identity, as well as the signature of the party who makes the
first deposit.</p>

<p>A depositor who cannot write will have to bring with him a
trustworthy man, who will have to attest the identity of the
depositor and to sign the deposit-book in his stead.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>An assignment of a deposit-book to another person, is only
to be accepted by the Post Office Savings Bank when the act
of assignment has taken place at a Post Office entrusted with
Post Office Savings Bank business.</p>

<p>This being done, the assignee is to be regarded as the proprietor
of the deposit-book. (Art. 21, &sect; 3.)</p>

<p>Minors are entitled to pay in sums as savings and to receive
repayments back provided their legal representatives have entered
no written objection at the Post Office Savings Bank.</p>

<p>In case of the loss of the deposit-book, a duplicate is, after
carrying out the proceedings prescribed by article 14, to be
issued.</p>

<p>Whoever causes two or more deposit-books to be issued
loses the interests on the capital entered in the second and in
any subsequent books.</p>

<p>If the whole amount of the deposits in the two or more
deposit-books, that a depositor has caused to be issued, is over
the sum of a 1,000 florins, the depositor loses that part of the
capital which exceeds 1,000 florins.</p>

<p>The Minister of Commerce is empowered on well considered
reasons to be indulgent with reference to the loss of capital,
which, in conformity with the regulations occurs to surplus
deposits.</p>

<p>Post Office servants are forbidden, except to their superiors,
to give any information whatever to anyone, as to the names of
depositors, or the amount of their deposits.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 7<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a>.</span></h4>

<p>Each single payment must amount to at least 50 kreutzers
or a multiple of 50 kreutzers.</p>

<p>The balance in favour of a depositor can at no time amount
to more than 1,000 florins including deposits paid in and
interest added to the capital.</p>

<p>Deposits of 50 kreutzers can be made in postage stamps,
or in special postal savings stamps as soon as such stamps
are issued by the Minister of Commerce. These stamps are
to be fastened on forms supplied gratuitously.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 8<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a>.</span></h4>

<p>The rate of interest for savings deposits, which is never to
exceed 3 per cent per annum, after having been placed before
the special Council (art. 1) will be fixed by the Minister of
Commerce in concert with the Ministers of the Interior and of
Finances, by way of ordinances, and every alteration is to be
published in the Imperial Law Pamphlets (<i>Reichs-Gesetz-Blatte</i>)
in the official part of the &laquo;Vienna Gazette&raquo; (<i>Wiener Zeitung</i>)
and in the various official gazettes.</p>

<p>The new rate of interest will begin to come into operation on
the 1<sup>st</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> of the month which follows its publication
and will also apply to deposits made previously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Article 9.</span></h4>

<p>Savings deposits bear interest commencing from the 1<sup>st</sup>
or the 16<sup>th</sup> day of the month following the date of their
payment, and the interest ends on the 15<sup>th</sup> or last day of
the month preceding the arrival of the notice of the expiration
of the agreement with the Post Office Savings Bank at Vienna.</p>

<p>Sums under a florin are not to bear interest.</p>

<p>The 31<sup>st</sup> of December, each year, the interests accruing are
to be added to the capital and from that time forward they also
bear interest.</p>

<p>In the calculation of interest each month is to be regarded as
30 days.</p>

<p>The officially prepared table of interest is to be publicly
posted up in the receiving offices (post offices).</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 10.</span></h4>

<p>Any amount exceeding 1,000 florins to the credit of a savings
deposit is not to bear interest.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 11.</span></h4>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank is obliged as soon as the deposits
and capitalized interest of a depositor surpasses the figure
of 1,000 florins, by a registered letter, to require the depositor
to lessen his capital.</p>

<p>If during the month following the depositor has not lessened
the balance to his credit, then at the expiration of the period,
bonds of the state debt bearing interest in notes will in the
course of the day be officially bought to the nominal amount of
200 florins, and the depositor is to be informed of the fact.</p>

<p>From the time of the sending out of the notice until the
reduction is effected in the balance to the credit of a depositor
no interest will accrue.</p>

<p>In case the depositor on whose account the bonds were
bought, does not withdraw the documents, the Post Office
Savings Bank will receive the interest falling in on the bonds
under its care and will enter these interests in the books of the
institutions as a new deposit in favour of the depositor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>For the State funds belonging to a depositor lying at the Post
Office Savings Bank a book is to be issued.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 12.</span></h4>

<p>At the request of a depositor and that the balance in his
favour is sufficient, it can be employed in the purchase of
Austrian State Funds.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 13<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a>.</span></h4>

<p>The payment back of the balance in favour of a depositor or
any part of it to him or to his legal heir or authorised agent,
will take place upon a notice which can be made by the party
giving it, at the receiving office (Post Office) which he names in
the notice.</p>

<p>The payment back is to made through the receiving office
(Post Office) named in the notice, on production of the deposit-book,
on the basis of an assignment by the Post Office Savings
Bank, except the payment is according to Article 14 barred
by legal proceedings having been instituted, or according to
Articles 6 and 17, by a protest having been made.</p>

<p>When such notice has been given with reference to sums up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>to 10 florins, the assignment will be sent by the Post Office
Savings Bank by return of post and the payment back will be
made by the receiving office (Post Office) immediately after its
arrival.</p>

<p>The repayment of sums between 10 and 100 florins will be
made in a fortnight at the latest, that of sums between 100 and
500 florins in a month at the latest, that of sums above 500 florins,
at the latest within two months after the arrival of the notice.</p>

<p>The Administration is however authorised, with power of
countermand and under necessary precautions to permit sums
up to 20 florins of which notice has been given to be immediately
paid at one of the authorised receiving offices without
waiting for the arrival of the foregoing assignment from the
Post Office Savings Bank.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 14.</span></h4>

<p>If a deposit-book proves to be lost the following proceedings
occur:</p>

<p>The owner has, in order to obtain a duplicate to give immediate
notice of the loss, either directly to the Post Office
Savings Bank, or to the nearest receiving office (Post Office)
with as exact an account as possible of its characteristic marks.</p>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank immediately orders a note of
the characteristic marks to be entered in its books with the
result that meanwhile no payment is made to anyone on the
lost deposit-book.</p>

<p>At the same time the Post Office Savings Bank causes a
public placard to be put up at the Post Office where the lost
book was issued, and also in that to which perhaps it might be
forwarded, by which all persons are informed that at the expiration
of a month from the date of its publication, if no claim to
the lost book is made in the interval, it will be cancelled and
declared null and void, and a new one issued.</p>

<p>If within the month no claim is made, the Post Office Savings
Bank will on payment of a fee of 10 kreutzers Austrian currency,
issue a duplicate and declare the deposit-book proved
lost, to be null and void.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>If a claim is made during the course of a month, the Post
Office Savings Bank must refer the parties to the ordinary tribunals,
and no duplicate is to be issued nor any proceedings
permitted with reference to the lost book until the validity of
the outstanding claim has been decided by a legal judgement.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 15.</span></h4>

<p>The statement of paragraph 1480 of the General Civil Code,
by which claims to arrears of interests are lost after three years,
has no application to interests of depositors in the Post Office
Savings Bank.</p>

<p>In relation to the lapse of Post Office Savings Bank deposits
the ordinary legal decisions will be relied upon. Lapsed
deposits fall into the postal treasury. Such a lapsing of
deposits will be stopped by every new payment, every notice
for payment back, every entry of interest in the deposit book.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 16.</span></h4>

<p>State bonds bought officially, or at the request of depositors,
and kept at the Post Office Savings Bank fall into the postal
treasury, if, during a lapse of 40 years, no one has laid claim
either to the deposit or to the interest, and the depositor has
not forwarded to the Post Office Savings Bank any order
whatever with reference to them.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 17.</span></h4>

<p>Neither savings deposited at the Post Office Savings Bank,
nor the Post Office Savings Bank deposit-books can be
sequestered, and in like manner they cannot be used as security.
Nor can a deposit-book be seized or taken in distraint.</p>

<p>These restrictions have no application to the books mentioned
in Articles 11 and 12, as issued for the state bonds
bought for a depositor.</p>

<p>If a depositor declares himself insolvent, the Official Receiver
is empowered to give notice to the Post Office Savings
Bank to pay him the balance in favour of the depositor, and
thereon to give a receipt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>A protest against the payment back of a savings deposit can
only be considered in case a lawsuit has been entered into
with reference to the right of property in a deposit-book,
or on the hypothesis which Article 6 meets.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 18.</span></h4>

<p>The reserve fund which is primarily intended to cover every
possible loss which may occur to the Post Office Savings Bank
is to be formed by the laying aside of the surpluses which
remain at the close of the administrative years from the produce
of the savings-money deposited, after deduction for
interest paid, administrative and other expenses, and after
restitution of the advances made from the postal budget.</p>

<p>The reserve fund is to be gradually stored up until it reaches
5 per cent of the total amount of the deposits, but it must never
go beyond the point of two million Austrian florins.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 19.</span></h4>

<p>The reserve fund capital is to be placed at interest and
whatever it brings in is to be added to the reserve fund so long
as this last has not reached the maximum fixed.</p>

<p>When the reserve fund has reached the above mentioned
point, all the business profits will be entered to the credit of the
Postal Revenue.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 20.</span></h4>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank is to render a formal account
of the administration of the savings-money paid in at the receiving
offices (Post offices), and the duty of the control lies with
the supreme audit-office.</p>

<p>At the end of each solar year the Minister of Commerce will
communicate to both Houses of the Imperial Council, a detailed
business statement with reference to the administration, working
and position of the Post Office Savings Bank and will publish
the same in the official part of the &laquo;Vienna Gazette&raquo;.</p>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank will periodically make known
the actual position of the institution in the &laquo;Vienna Gazette&raquo;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 21.</span></h4>

<p>The correspondence of the Post Office Savings Bank and its
organs with the depositors is post free.</p>

<p>The revenue of the Post Office Savings Bank is exempt from
duty.</p>

<p>In the business of the Post Office Savings Bank all legal
documents passing between the Bank, the authorities or the
organs of the Bank and the depositors, their legal heirs or
authorised agents, are free from stamp duty and taxes. In like
manner the interest of savings-deposits is exempt from the
Income-tax and from any tax which may replace it in time to
come.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 22.</span></h4>

<p>The exact time when the Post Office Savings Bank in
Vienna, as well as the receiving offices will commence their
work will be fixed by the Minister of Commerce.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article 23.</span></h4>

<p>The carrying out of this law is entrusted to the Minister of
Commerce.</p>


<h3>II<br />

Law of November 19<sup>th</sup> 1897</h3>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p><i>containing alterations in the Law of May 28^{th} 1882 (R. G. Bl.
N<sup>o</sup> 56) and decisions with regard to the Orders' (Cheque and
Clearing) Service of the Post Office Savings Bank (R. G. Bl.
N<sup>o</sup> 133).</i></p></div>

<p>With the consent of the two Houses of the Imperial Council
I ordain as follows:</p>


<h4>&sect; 1.</h4>

<p>The arrangements of the Law of May 28<sup>th</sup> 1882, contained
in the Articles 5, 6, 7, 8 and 13 (<i>R. G. Bl.</i> N<sup>o</sup> 56) will no
longer be in force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>In their stead will come the following arrangements, indicated
in the articles bearing the same numbers.</p>

<p>(<i>The articles altered: 5, 6, 7, 8 and 13, are with their new text
given in Appendix I, containing the Law of May 28<sup>th</sup> 1882.</i>)</p>


<h4>&sect; 2.</h4>

<p>To the existing Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service of
the Post Office Savings Bank the modifications in the Law of
May 28<sup>th</sup> 1882 (<i>R. G. Bl.</i> N<sup>o</sup> 56) as well as the alterations
refered to in &sect; 1 of the present Law, have no application.</p>

<p>An exception, however, occurs with reference to articles 1,
20 and 21 of the above mentioned Law which are to be applied
to the aforesaid service conformably to their sense.</p>

<p>In addition to which the Government is authorized to regulate
this service by way of ordinances.</p>

<p>Apart from such regulations the service is to proceed according
to the following determinations.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3.</h4>

<p>The administration and keeping of the accounts of the
Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service at the Post Office
Savings Bank are to be carried on separately from those of the
Savings' service.</p>

<p>Participation in the Cheque service with or without inclusion
in the Clearing service is to be granted by the Post Office
Savings Bank on paying in a guarantee deposit.</p>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank will open an account for each
participant.</p>


<h4>&sect; 4.</h4>

<p>The guarantee deposit remains in the Post Office Savings
Bank as long as the holder of the account continues a participant
in the Cheque service and contingently also in the Clearing
service.</p>

<p>In case a holder of an account on the one side, or the Post
Office Savings Bank on the other, wishes to give notice to withdraw,
which either can do at any time, the guarantee-deposit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
will, within a fortnight at latest after receiving the notice, be
repaid.</p>

<p>To the Post Office Savings belongs also the right by giving
notice of the repayment of the guarantee-deposit to cause the
immediate withdrawal of a participant and it has also the right
to decline, without giving any reason a request to participate in
the Cheque and Clearing service.</p>


<h4>&sect; 5.</h4>

<p>The amount of the guarantee-deposit, which is on every
occasion to be paid in specie, will be always fixed by way of
ordinance.</p>

<p>This fixing can be arranged in such a way, that in the event
of the whole transactions exceeding an agreed maximum sum
the guarantee deposit is to be increased.</p>


<h4>&sect; 6.</h4>

<p>The rate of interest for deposits in the Orders' (Cheque and
Clearing) service cannot rise higher than two per cent per
annum.</p>

<p>The Government is empowered within this maximum point
to fix the rate of interest for deposits.</p>

<p>The Government can also ordain that the abovementioned
deposits, especially the guarantee deposits shall either bear no
interest at all or only partially do so.</p>


<h4>&sect; 7.</h4>

<p>Of the money paid into the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing)
Service of the Post Office Savings Bank there will always be
kept in hand a portion in specie adequate to meet probable
needs.</p>

<p>The surplus remaining is to be placed out at interest in such
a way as always to assure the complete fulfilment of the engagements
entered into.</p>

<p>The placing out can be made:</p>

<p>1. By acquiring partially mortgaged bills of exchange (salt
mine, treasury bonds).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>2. By opening at a banking establishment a running account
at short dates of payment (a deposit running account).</p>

<p>3. By advances on security of bonds of the United
National Debt and of the National Debt of the kingdoms and
lands represented in the Imperial Council, also those Austrian
bills upon which loans are permitted by the statutes of the
Austro-Hungarian Bank, finally upon stock and other securities
in the Austro-Hungarian Bank. (Advances with the
exception of accounts booked.)</p>

<p>4. By discounting coupons of the funds pointed out in
N<sup>o</sup> 3, also in prize-tickets in the Austrian State Lottery, also of
other funds indicated in N<sup>o</sup> 3, repayable by draft, last on discharge
certificates of Customs duties.</p>

<p>5. By discounting Bills of Exchange to be cashed at a
Bank, a Savings Bank, or else at a Deposit or Credit Company,
registered according to the Law of April 9<sup>th</sup> 1873 (Z. 70
R. G. Bl.).</p>

<p>6. By purchase of bonds of the National Debt, deeds of
mortgage or bonds having priority rights, in so far as such
stocks are, in conformity with N<sup>o</sup> 3, capable of being taken in
deposit.</p>

<p>The duration of the loans described in N<sup>o</sup> 3, as well as the
paper to be discounted, described in N<sup>o</sup> 4, and the bills of
Exchange within the kingdoms and lands represented in the
Imperial Council as described in N<sup>o</sup> 5, is limited to three
months.</p>

<p>In selecting what to take in deposit, or what to buy, in
fixing the extent of the sum to be lent out, as well as the choice
of the institutions with which it is to enter into business relations,
the Post Office Savings Bank is to seek direction from
the Ministry of Finance.</p>


<h4>&sect; 8.</h4>

<p>The Orders (Cheques) issued in the Orders' (Cheque and
Clearing) Service are subject to no other tax than that fixed by
the Law of February 29<sup>th</sup> 1864, &sect; 7 (R. G. Bl. N<sup>o</sup> 20) of 2 kreutzers
a piece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>The declarations which, in conformity with the regulations
of the Orders Service are added to the order (cheque) by the
Drawer, especially such as the declaration by which a third
person is designated as Receiver of the sums assigned, or by
which commissions are given for the issuing of post-office
orders or the retiring of bills, etc.; also the authorisations for
the Post Office Savings Bank and the receipt-vouchers, reciprocally
given by the Post Office Savings Bank Office and
participants, are free from stamp duty and taxation.</p>

<p>In like manner the extracts forwarded to parties from their
accounts are free from stamp duty and taxation.</p>

<p>In respect of sums received in current account by the Post
Office Savings Bank, the payment of the percentage tax fixed
by the Law of February 29<sup>th</sup> 1864, &sect; 7, paragraph 2 (R. G. Bl.
N<sup>o</sup> 20) does not operate.</p>


<h4>&sect; 9.</h4>

<p>For the use of the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service
the Post Office is to impose special fees.</p>

<p>In addition to the already existing fees and repayment of
the cost price of printed matter supplied to parties interested,
the Government is empowered to impose to the amount stated
below the following fees:</p>

<p>1. A record-fee of 2 kreutzers for each official act with reference
to the account (Deposit, Assignment, Entry to credit
or debit).</p>

<p>2. A commission up to the maximum of &frac14; the thousand on
the paying out side of the account (Entering to the debit).
These fees are to be taken by the Post Office Savings Bank
deducting them from the account.</p>


<h4>&sect; 10.</h4>

<p>For the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service, a special
Reserve fund is to be formed, which is primarily intended to
cover possible losses which may result from the service.</p>

<p>This Reserve fund is to be formed from what remains of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
surpluses at the close of the administrative year after deduction
resulting from the possible deficit in the Savings Service.</p>

<p>This allotment of the surpluses is to continue as long as the
Reserve fund designated has not reached the point of 5 per cent
of what remains of the deposit capital in the Orders' (Cheque
and Clearing) Service, at the close of the year, after deduction
of the payments back.</p>

<p>The money of the Reserve fund formed for the Orders'
(Cheque and Clearing) Service is to be placed out at interest
under the restrictions of &sect; 7 as to the nature of such arrangements,
and the produce accruing from time to time, is to be
added to the Reserve until it has reached the abovementioned
point.</p>

<p>The Reserve fund having reached this point, the whole of
the profits on the business done in the Orders' (Cheque and
Clearing) Service will accrue as receipts to the Postal
Revenue.</p>

<p>To what remains the determinations of Article 4 of the Law
of May 28<sup>th</sup> 1882 (R. G. Bl. N<sup>o</sup> 56) understood in conformity
with their sense will apply.</p>


<h4>&sect; 11.</h4>

<p>The determinations of &sect;&sect; 2 to 10 of the present Law apply
from the time it comes into operation, also to deposits paid in
before that time to the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service
of the Post Office Savings Bank.</p>


<h4>&sect; 12.</h4>

<p>With the execution of this Law which comes into operation
from the date of its publication, together with the partially
altered Law of May 28<sup>th</sup> 1882 (R. G. Bl. N<sup>o</sup> 56) My Minister of
Commerce and My Minister of Finance are charged.</p>

Law of November 19<sup>th</sup> 1887 (R. G. Bl. N<sup>o</sup> 133) Regulations
with reference to the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service in
the Post Office Savings Bank are issued.</i></p></div>

<p>In carrying out the Law of November 19<sup>th</sup> 1887 (R. G. Bl.
N<sup>o</sup> 133) by which alterations were made in the Law of
May 28<sup>th</sup> 1882 (R. G. Bl. N<sup>o</sup> 56), and determinations with
regard to the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service in the
Post Office Savings Bank, the Ministry of Commerce in agreement
with the Ministry of the Interior and the Finance Ministry
ordains as follows:</p>


<h4>A.&mdash;<i>Savings Service.</i></h4>


<h5>&sect; 1.</h5>

<p>The highest point of the rate of interest, according to the
determination of the Special Council of the Post Office Savings
Bank, is to be fixed at <i>three</i> per cent per annum.</p>


<h5>&sect; 2.</h5>

<p>Whoever pays the first deposit in favour of another&mdash;of
the Depositor and signs the deposit-book in this name, is to
be called the Payer.</p>

<p>The Depositor is at any time entitled without the intervention
of the Payer to appear at a Receiving Office and to have his
own signature accepted.</p>

<p>As long as the Depositor has not exercised this right, the
Post Office Savings Bank will consider the Payer as authorised
in the name of the Depositor to dispose of the balance in his
favour, unless the Post Office Savings Bank has been made
aware that it is against the depositor's will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>


<h5>&sect; 3.</h5>

<p>Until further notice Repayments may be made of sums up to
20 florins, immediately upon notice of recall, by duly authorised
Receiving Offices, without previous assignment from the
Post Office Savings Bank.</p>


<h5>&sect; 4.</h5>

<p>Business regulations which have been made by the Post
Office Savings Bank not in present agreement with the arrangements
of articles 5, 6, 7, 8 and 13 of the Law of November
19<sup>th</sup> 1887 (R. G. Bl. N<sup>o</sup> 133) in relation with &sect;&sect; 2 and 3 of
the present Ordinance are out of force.</p>


<h4>B.&mdash;<i>Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service.</i></h4>


<h5>&sect; 5.</h5>

<p>In carrying out &sect; 2 of the Law of November 19<sup>th</sup> 1887
(R. G. Bl. N<sup>o</sup> 133), the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service
of the Post Office Savings Bank is to be regulated by the rules
existing with reference to them in the Post Office Savings
Bank applied in such a manner as the alterations of the aforesaid
Law as well as the following determinations render
necessary.</p>


<h5>&sect; 6.</h5>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank will keep separate the
accounts and administration of the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing)
Service from those of the Savings Service.</p>

<p>Participation in the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service
is also to be allowed to persons who are not depositors in the
Savings Service. It will be granted on payment of a Guarantee-deposit,
and of course if the participant wishes he can enter
the Clearing as well as the Cheque Service.</p>

<p>In order to obtain permission to be a participant in the
Orders' Service the person wishing to enter has to ask for an
account to be opened and to pay in the Guarantee-deposit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>This request is to be made on one of the forms issued by the
Post Office Savings Bank, which are to be delivered gratuitously
at all post-offices and to be forwarded to Vienna post paid
under an enclosure containing the sum for the desired Cheque
and Receipt books.</p>

<p>To the Post Office Savings Bank belongs the right to refuse
a request for admission as participant in the Orders' (Cheque
and Clearing) Service without giving reasons (&sect; 4 of the Law).</p>

<p>The Guarantee-deposit is to be paid within a month at any
Receiving Office after the grant of the said request by using a
Receipt (Pay) certificate.</p>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank opens an account for each
participant. Deposit-books are no longer to be used in the
Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service.</p>


<h5>&sect; 7.</h5>

<p>The amount of the Guarantee-deposit will until further
notice be fixed at 100 florins.</p>

<p>The Guarantee-deposit will remain at the Post Office Savings
Bank as long as the holder of an account continues a participant
in the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service. During participation
in the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service, the Guarantee-deposit
cannot be disposed of and in case the participant
should withdraw from the Service it can only be paid back upon
15 days notice (&sect; 4 of the Law).</p>


<h5>&sect; 8.</h5>

<p>The deposits in the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service,
including the Guarantee-deposit, will until further notice bear
interest at 2 per cent per annum. The interest begins from the
1<sup>st</sup> or from the 16<sup>th</sup> of the month following the booking of the
deposit, and terminates at the expiration of the 15<sup>th</sup> or from the
last day of the month which precedes the writing off from the
account of the sum assigned for payment.</p>

<p>Sums under one florin will not bear interest.</p>

<p>On the 31<sup>st</sup> of December in every year the interest accruing
will be added to the capital and will in like manner bear interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>In reckoning the interest every month will be regarded as
thirty days.</p>


<h5>&sect; 9.</h5>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank has always the right to give
notice to a participant to withdraw his Guarantee-deposit, with
the result that from the day the participant receives the notice
he can no longer dispose of the balance to his credit by way of
cheques (&sect; 4 of the Law).</p>


<h5>&sect; 10.</h5>

<p>For making use of the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing) Service,
besides the fees at present existing&mdash;under which are
included the fee of 2 kreutzers the cheque, already fixed by &sect; 8
of the Law of November 19<sup>th</sup> 1887, and according to rule the
equivalent of the cost price of the various printed documents
furnished to participants in the service,&mdash;the under mentioned
fees will be taken:</p>

<p>1. A record-fee of 2 kreutzers for each official act with reference
to the account (Deposit, Assignment, Entering to Credit
or Debit);</p>

<p>2. A commission on each entry to the debit up to the sum of
3,000 florins at the rate of &frac14; the thousand, and 1/8 the thousand
for sums exceeding that amount.</p>

<p>These fees will be taken by writing them off the account.</p>

<p>From the commission, however, are free:</p>

<p><i>a</i>) The Debit Entries in the Clearing Service;</p>

<p><i>b</i>) Sums sent by means of Post Office Orders through the
Post Office Savings Bank;</p>

<p><i>c</i>) Sums written off in the Cheque Service on account of a
purchase of State-bonds made for a participant, finally;</p>

<p><i>d</i>) Every entry of fees, commissions, etc. in favour of the
Post Office Savings Bank.</p>


<h5>&sect; 11.</h5>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank will keep for three years the
accounts, documents and writings in the Orders' (Cheque and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Clearing) Service relating to business concluded; it can only
therefore give consideration to claims with reference to payments
in, assignments, payments back, interest and fees, etc.,
when they come within this period.</p>

<p>To claims which refer to a Post Office missive (Paying in
Order, Post Office Order, Registered Letter and the like) the
Post Office regulations as to the time in which such claims can
be made will apply.</p>


<h5>&sect; 12.</h5>

<p>The foregoing regulations &sect;&sect; 5 to 11 apply from the time this
ordinance comes into operation, and will also apply from the
same time to all deposits already made in the Orders' (Cheque
and Clearing) Service, (&sect; 11 of the Law).</p>


<h5>&sect; 13.</h5>

<p>The Officials of the Post Office Savings Bank and of the
Receiving Offices are bound by duty to keep the business and
official secrets, and not to give to any third person, except
their superiors, any kind of information whatever with reference
to the name of a depositor, to the sums paid in or
paid back, or to the amount of the balance in hand.</p>


<h4>FINAL REGULATIONS</h4>


<h5>&sect; 14.</h5>

<p>The Receiving Offices of the Post Office Savings Bank will
receive at the End of each calendar year an indemnity for business
done in the Post Office Savings Bank Service.</p>

<p>This indemnity amounts to:</p>

<p><i>a</i>) Two kreutzers at the close of each year for every deposit-book
issued at the Receiving Office in question during the year
and then existing.</p>

<p><i>b</i>) One and a quarter kreutzer for every payment during the
year effected at the Receiving Office in question, into the
Savings Service and into the Orders' (Cheque and Clearing)
Service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>


<h5>&sect; 15.</h5>

<p>This Ordinance will come into force at the same time as the
Law of November 19<sup>th</sup> 1887 (R. G. Bl. N<sup>o</sup> 133).</p>


<h3>IV<br />

Instruction concerning the Savings Service
of the Post Office Savings Bank.</h3>


<h4>1.&mdash;<i>Receiving Offices.</i></h4>

<p>All post offices in the kingdoms and lands represented in the
Imperial Council are appointed to be Receiving Offices of the
Post Office Savings Bank, and have daily during the prescribed
hours to carry out the Post Office Savings Bank Service.
They receive deposits, effect payments back, give information
about all branches of the Post Office Savings Bank Service,
and in connection with this Institution, aid the depositors in
every way.</p>


<h4>2.&mdash;<i>Depositors and Payers.</i></h4>

<p>Any one can become a Depositor in the Post Office Savings
Bank and obtain a deposit-book, or cause another person to
obtain one, upon making, in conformity with the regulations, a
payment at a Receiving Office, of a given sum within the prescribed
limits.</p>

<p>Societies, Unions, Cooperative Associations and persons
having a legal position are competent depositors in the Post
Office Savings Bank.</p>

<p>The person in whose name the book has been issued is to
be regarded as the Depositor.</p>

<p>No Depositor is permitted to obtain, or cause to be obtained
on his behalf, more than one deposit-book issued in his name;
on the other hand every one is free, beyond their own deposit-books,
to obtain for other, wholly distinct persons, deposit-books
and to pay in deposits on their behalf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Whoever in favour of another,&mdash;the depositor,&mdash;pays in
the first payment and signs the deposit-book in his name is
called the Payer.</p>

<p>Any one can be a Depositor who can read and write. Minors
no more than persons having a legal position are debarred from
being depositors.</p>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank regards the Payer as empowered
in the name of the Depositor to dispose of the balance
to his credit as long as the latter has not informed the Post
Office Savings Bank that it is against his will.</p>

<p>This can be done by the Depositor signing his own name in
the deposit-book at a post office.</p>

<p>The admission of the signature can take place:</p>

<p><i>a</i>) In the presence of and with the consent of the Payer;</p>

<p><i>b</i>) Without the intervention of the Payer.</p>

<p>In the first case the Payer confirms the authenticity of the
signature, in the second case the Depositor has to establish
his own personal identity.</p>


<h4>3.&mdash;<i>The Deposits.</i></h4>

<p>The smallest deposit is 50 kreutzers, larger deposits must be
a multiple of that sum.</p>

<p>In order to render possible the saving of smaller sums than
50 kreutzers, Post Office Savings Cards have been issued.</p>

<p>Post Office Savings Cards are cards imprinted with a
postage stamp of 5 kreutzers, and having the necessary room to
fasten on further stamps; these cards are sold at all Post
Offices, and by all postage stamp vendors on payment of the
value of the imprinted stamp. Such a Post Office Savings
Card with stamps fastened on to the value of 50 kreutzers will
be accepted at the Receiving Offices of the Post Office Savings
Bank as a deposit.</p>

<p>One and the same depositor can only be permitted to bring
for deposit three Post Office Savings Cards during one week,
either singly or at the same time.</p>

<p>The balance of a depositor in paid up deposits and capita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>lised
interests is not permitted to amount at any time to more
than 1,000 florins.</p>

<p>The Depositor must with the first deposit inscribe his signature
in the place appointed on the third page of the deposit-book
and must further give an account of his calling or occupation,
the place, day, month, year of his birth, as well as the
place where he lives and his address. He must moreover sign
with his own hand the so-called &laquo;<i>Gegenschein</i>&raquo; (Counter-certificate)
to be found in the deposit book. And he himself choose
a given private &laquo;Watchword&raquo; (<i>Losungswort</i>) and inscribe it in
the appointed place in the counter-certificate.</p>

<p>The result of this will be that payments back in the customary
way can only follow on giving this watchword.</p>

<p>A person who cannot write is obliged to bring with him a
witness who authenticates the depositors mark by his own
signature. To those known personally to the Post Office
official, or, who identify themselves by means of a certificate of
domicile, a passport or a work-or service book, the Post
Office official can himself become the witness.</p>

<p>In the case of Societies, Unions, Cooperative Associations
and persons having a legal position either the bringer of the
first deposit can give his signature and be then regarded as the
Payer, or no signature will be received. In the latter case
nothing can be done with reference to the deposits until the
Payer by means of an official document, N<sup>o</sup> 14, signifies to
the Post Office Savings Bank who will be authorised to give
notices of withdrawals and to collect payments.</p>

<p>Subsequent payments can be effected on each book at any
office without further notice and without its being necessary
for the person to come personally.</p>

<p>Every deposit must be at once entered in the deposit-book
by the Post Office official and this entry is to be certified by
the imprint of the Receiving Offices stamp of the day and the
signature of the Post Office official. The Depositor (Payer) is
bound before leaving the office to examine the entries sufficiently
so as to see that they are correct.</p>

<p>Deposits are also received from Rural Agents to the limit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
300 florins for each deposit-book and for each commission
bought. Deposits up to 5 florins pay no fee. For deposits of
more than 5 florins a receiving-fee of 5 kreutzers is charged.</p>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank receives from Depositors,
Coupons of Austrian Bond falling due and enters the proceeds
in the deposit-book and to the depositors account.</p>

<p>To this end the coupons together with the deposit-book are
either to be given in at the Bank of the Office, or forwarded
post-paid to the Post Office Savings Bank at Vienna.</p>

<p>Each single coupon given in or forwarded must have legibly
written on the back, the number of the deposit-book and the
depositor's name, if not, a list of the sorts and numbers of the
coupons as well as the number of the deposit-book will have to
be given.</p>

<p>For receiving the coupons the Post Office Savings Bank
charges a commission of 1 kreutzer the coupon, which will be
deducted from what it produces.</p>

<p>The sending-back of the deposit-book will be post free.</p>

<p>It is moreover allowable when a depositor has to receive at
a post office not dependent on the Treasury a sum by order,&mdash;whether
it be an ordinary post office order, or a repayment&mdash;or
transfer post-office order, or finally by a pay-order in the
cheque service of the Post Office Savings Bank, not to pay
the same in cash, but have it immediately entered in the
deposit-book.</p>


<h4>4.&mdash;<i>Acknowledgments of Receipts.</i></h4>

<p>Beyond the entry which the Post Office Service makes in
the deposit-book, the depositors receive, and so, relatively,
payers, upon each deposit an acknowledgment of receipt from
the Post Office Savings Bank at Vienna, forwarded every time
to their address or to <i>poste restante</i> as they desire. Should
this acknowledgment of receipt not have reached a depositor
within 14 days, or should it contain some errors with reference
to the sum or name or in some other way be erroneous, the
depositor has to find in his deposit-book, &laquo;Complaint&raquo;, and
to separate the paper, fill it in conformity with the case, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
to forward it in an envelope, N<sup>o</sup> 42<sup>o</sup>, which he will receive
gratis at any post office.</p>

<p>Other blank forms of complaint are gratuitously supplied at
every post-office.</p>

<p>For entries of interest and coupon the Post Office Savings
Bank does not give receipts.</p>


<h4>5.&mdash;<i>Replacement of Lost, Spoiled or Filled in Deposit-books.</i></h4>

<p>Should a deposit-book be lost, the loser must notify the fact
to the Post Office Savings Bank at Vienna, on a printed form,
supplied gratuitously at every Receiving Office, stating the
peculiar marks of the lost book as exactly as he can possibly
remember them, also the particular circumstances under which
the loss took place, as well as his full address, enclosing at the
same time 10 kreutzers in postage stamps and the notice
of withdrawal book, requesting that a duplicate of the deposit-book
lost may be given him. Should the notice-book be also
mislaid, this is to be notified on the printed form and the sum
of five kreutzers added for a new notice-book.</p>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank notes down the loss and until
further notice makes no payment on the lost deposit-book.</p>

<p>Meanwhile arrangements will be made for its annulment and
if during the space of a month no claim is raised, a duplicate
book will be issued and forwarded.</p>

<p>If no room can be found in a deposit-book for further
entries, or it has become torn or so dirty as to become useless,
the depositor has to send it with the printed form, N<sup>o</sup> 11,
properly filled up to Post Office Savings Bank at Vienna for
exchange. Books filled up will be exchanged gratuitously, for
a spoilt book, however, the sum of 10 kreutzers is to be added
to the request. In case the notice book is also spoilt, the sum
of 5 kreutzers is to be added for issuing a new one.</p>


<h4>6.&mdash;<i>Interest.</i></h4>

<p>Deposits begin to yield interest at three per cent per annum
from one florin upwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Interest begins from the 1<sup>st</sup> or from the 16<sup>th</sup> day of the month
which follows on the deposit and ends with the 15<sup>th</sup> or with the
last day of the month which precedes the arrival of the notice
of withdrawal from the Post Office Savings Bank.</p>

<p>On December 31<sup>st</sup> of each year the interest accruing will be
added to the capital and from that time it will, in like manner
bear interest.</p>

<p>To each depositor, the Post Office Savings Bank sends at
the close of the year an interest-order, valid for two months
with an announcement of the amount of interest which has
accrued to him for the year ending December 31<sup>st</sup>. The
depositor must cause the amount of this interest to be entered
in his deposit-book within the prescribed two months, on
presentation of the interest order at some Receiving Office.</p>

<p>If a depositor has not within the time allowed caused the
entry of the capitalised interest to be effected as per order
received, he does not lose the interest, only he has to forward
his book to the Post Office Savings Bank for the purpose of
having it entered there.</p>

<p>The determination of &sect; 1480 of the general Civil Code according
to which claims on arrears of interest lapse after three
years, do not apply to the interest on deposits in the Post Office
Savings Bank.</p>

<p>With reference to the lapsing of Post Office Savings Bank
deposits the general legal decisions are valid.</p>

<p>This lapsing will be arrested by any fresh deposit, by any
fresh notice or by any fresh entry of interest in the deposit-book.</p>


<h4>7.&mdash;<i>Notice of Withdrawal.</i></h4>

<p>A depositor or the legal successors or authorised agents of a
depositor are entitled at any time to require through the
prescribed notice the payment back of any part of the deposit
or the whole deposit. Sums less than a florin can, however,
only be recalled if the deposit-book proves that the total
amount deposited does not exceed the amount recalled.
Notice of withdrawal is given on a special document, that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
on a leaf out of the notice-book which the depositor receives
gratuitously at the same time as the deposit-book. These
leaves are to be detached according to the order determined by
the numbers printed on them, to be duly filled up and forwarded
undercover (document N<sup>o</sup> 42<sup>b</sup>) to the Post Office Savings
Bank.</p>

<p>For the Notice of Withdrawal the following rules are to
regarded:</p>

<p>1. The Notices must always bear the signature which according
to instructions was received in the deposit-book, or communicated
to the Post Office Savings Bank on document N<sup>o</sup> 14.</p>

<p>2. The address to which the order should be sent must, where
<i>poste restante</i> is stated, in every case give the receiver's full name.
Addresses in figures cannot be used, because they are not
allowed on registered letters, and the orders for payment are
always sent for the greater security of the depositor by registered
letter.</p>

<p>3. The watchword chosen by the depositor must be added
to the Notice.</p>

<p>If the Depositor has forgotten his watchword he can at any
Receiving Office desire the issuing of a request to make it
known to him anew. To obtain this favour he must present
his deposit-book to the Post Office officials and prove himself
the Depositor (Payer). In case he is not personally known to
the officials, he must bring some witness who is known to
them, or a document capable of giving this proof (passport,
certificate of being naturalised, Work-or Service-book).</p>

<p>4. If the Depositor cannot write he must add his mark to the
notice-form and this mark must be attested by a witness.</p>

<p>Should the witness be the same one who attested the Depositor's
signature on the Counter-cheque and in the Deposit-book,
the Notice with the mark of the Depositor and the
signature of such a witness can be sent without further delay
to the Post Office Savings Bank.</p>

<p>But should the signature of this person be no longer adducible,
the Depositor has himself to go to a Receiving Office
and establish his own identity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of depositors who cannot write but have a
watchword, its declaration and the attestation of the mark by
any witness is enough.</p>

<p>The right is reserved to give Notice to withdraw the balance
to the Depositor's credit and to give a receipt for the same to
the Official Assignee, should the depositor fail,&mdash;to the
Guardian appointed by the authorities, should the depositor
become incapable of managing his affairs,&mdash;to the executor of
the estate with relation to the person to whom the right of
inheritance to the deposit-book belongs should the depositor
die. The persons designated, are required to address their
memorials direct to the Post Office Savings Bank, sustained
by the documents necessary to form a judgement of the case
together with the deposit-and notice-books. The deposits
of a deceased Depositor are to be withdrawn in full by notice
from the person who has the right of inheritance.</p>

<p>If a Notice-book has been used up, or in any way has
become useless, or a depositor has lost his notice-book, he can
on form N<sup>o</sup> 5<sup>d</sup> which will be supplied at all post offices gratuitously,
request the Post Office Savings Bank to forward him a
new Notice-book.</p>

<p>In the case of Notice-book lost or spoilt the sum of five
kreutzers must be added in postage-stamps; in that of an
ordinary used up Notice-book, a new one will be substituted
gratuitously.</p>


<h4>8.&mdash;<i>Repayment.</i></h4>

<p>Consequent on the Notice of withdrawal the Post Office
Savings Bank sends to the Depositor, to the address he has
named Payment-order valid for two months.</p>

<p>The order is sent as a rule by return of post, but in any case
soon enough for the repayment to take place within the limit
named by the Law of May 22<sup>nd</sup> 1882:&mdash;upon notice of sums
between 10 and 100 florins within 15 days, upon notice of sums
between 100 and 500 florins at the latest within a month, and
finally, upon notice of sums over 500 florins, at the latest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
within two months of the arrival of the notice at the Post
Office Savings Bank.</p>

<p>On delivery of this order, <i>the Depositor, in the presence of the
Post Office Official, putting his signature in receipt to the Payment
Order</i>, and on producing the deposit-book, in which the sum
paid back will be entered by the Post Office official and deducted
from the sum total of the balance, the repayment to the
depositor will follow at the pay-counter.</p>

<p>The Depositor can authorise any person he pleases to
receive payment of a sum thus withdrawn by notice. If he possesses
a watchword he needs only to duly fill in the form, N<sup>o</sup> 15
(authorisation) and to give or send it by the person authorised
with the deposit-book and the payment-order. On this person
presenting the authorisation and signing the payment-order,
and at the same time presenting the deposit book, the sum
will be paid.</p>

<p>But the Depositor can in like manner also request in the
Notice that the payment-order be sent to the person he has
authorised to receive it and whose address he has given. Then
the Depositor sends the deposit-book together with the authorisation
to the person he thus authorises to receive the payment.
But for payment of the sum the person thus authorised
must, if not personally known to the post office officials, produce
a document for his identification or establish his identity
by bringing with him a witness.</p>

<p>For authorisation without the watchword, the legalisation of
the signature of the withdrawer, either in a law court or by a
notary is requisite.</p>


<h4>9.&mdash;<i>Repayments without delay.</i></h4>

<p>But also without having to send a previous notice to the Post
Office Savings Bank, a Depositor (Payer) can at once at any
post office obtain repayments of sums from 1 to 20 florins.</p>

<p>Repayments can be made without delay on producing the
notice drawn out according to the regulations together with the
last acknowledgment of receipt or abstract of the credit account
with at the same time an entry of the sum in the deposit-book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Repayments made without delay are not allowed on authorisations,
also the whole balance of the depositor's account
cannot thus be withdrawn, but a sum of at least 50 kreutzers
must remain in the book. This sum as well as the interest can
then in the usual way be withdrawn by notice.</p>

<p>After each repayment made without delay, the depositor
receives a statement from the Post Office Savings Bank with
reference to his remaining balance (Statement of Credit-account),
on the ground of which he can again obtain a repayment
without delay.</p>

<p>Repayments without delay cannot be made with reference
to annulled deposit-books, or, with reference to deposit-books
concerning which a protest, recognised by the Post Office
Savings Bank has been made.</p>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank sends out no acknowledgements
of receipt upon entering and carrying to the depositor's
credit, interest and coupons,&mdash;the last receipt or statement of
balance of account is therefore valid for a repayment made without
delay; but the sum to be repaid must not include the
credited interests or coupons.</p>

<p>After repayments in the usual manner or after such payments
as the Post Office Savings Bank at Vienna itself makes
as well as after other debit entries in the deposit-book, as for
example purchases in the stocks, no statement with reference
to the remaining balance is given, the acknowledgement of the
receipt of the last deposit remains therefore in like manner valid
until the next repayment made without delay.</p>

<p>In the same way a statement with reference to the remaining
balance retains its validity without regard to these repayments
or debit entries, until in its place comes another acknowledgment
of receipt in consequence of a new deposit, or a new
statement with reference to the balance of the account in consequence
of a new payment made without delay.</p>

<p>It is evident of itself that a higher sum than the balance
remaining at the depositor's disposal after deduction of the last
repayment and entered in the book cannot at any time be paid.</p>

<p>Should it happen that owing to the Post Office Service the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
acknowledgment of the receipt of the last deposit has not come
into the depositor's hands, the previous receipt-acknowledgment,
or statement of balance will be considered valid; the
last deposit, not yet confirmed cannot however be included in
the payment requested.</p>

<p>If after a payment made without delay there remains less
than 1 fl. 50 kr. to the credit of the depositor, the Post Office
Savings Bank will issue no statement of the balance of the
account, since in such a case there can be no further payment
made without delay until there has been a new deposit paid
in followed by an acknowledgment of receipt.</p>

<p>At the bank of the Post Office Savings Bank at Vienna
repayments can be made without delay every day from 8 o'clock
in the morning until 6 o'clock in the evening (on Sundays and
holidays from 9 until 12 at noon) without regard to the amount
of the sums required.</p>

<p>To this end it is necessary to present at the Cashier's sliding
window the Notice-paper filled in and signed by the person
empowered to do this together with the deposit-book; bringing
the last receipt acknowledgment or statement of balance is not
requisite.</p>

<p>For sums above 20 florins, the depositor, in case he has no
watchword must prove his own identity.</p>


<h4>10.&mdash;<i>Business in the Public Funds.</i></h4>

<p>When the Savings account of a depositor's exceeds 1,000
florins, the Post Office Savings Bank is obliged to request the
depositor by a registered letter to lessen the amount of his saved
up capital.</p>

<p>If within a month after the request the depositor has not
lessened the amount of his capital, there will at the expiration
of the time, be bought on his account in the course of the day,
bonds of the only stock issued in notes, to the amount of the
sum required to reduce the account to 1,000 florins, in any case
for the nominal sum at least of 200 florins.</p>

<p>The price of this purchase will be entered to the debit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the depositor's account as repayment; the bonds bought will
remain under the care of the Post Office Savings Bank and a
Stocks-book will be forwarded to the depositor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Depositor (Payer) who has in the Post Office Savings
Bank an adequate sum at his disposal can at any time request
the Office to make purchases for him in the Public Funds.</p>

<p>The request for the purchase is to be drawn up on Form
N<sup>o</sup> 22, and must, if the purchased stock is to remain at the
Post Office Savings Bank contain a watchword. If the
depositor already has a watchword in connection with his
deposit book that watchword is to be inserted.</p>

<p>If a depositor cannot write he must make his mark and have
it attested by a witness. If this witness is the same person
who attested the depositor's mark on the counter-cheque and
in the deposit book, then the request with the mark of the
depositor and the signature of the witness can be sent without
further delay to the Post Office Savings Bank. But if the
signature of this witness cannot any longer be obtained, the
depositor has to go to a Receiving Office and himself prove his
own identity.</p>

<p>For the first purchase together with the request it is simply
necessary to enclose the deposit-book; for each subsequent
purchase the deposit-book and if it relates to deposited bonds
the stock account-book also must be sent.</p>

<p>The purchase is made as far as practicable according to the
state of the market as noted in the official price-list of the Vienna
Exchange on the day in which the request refered to reached
the Post Office Savings Bank, a commission being charged of
2 per thousand, which however cannot amount to less than
20 kreutzers.</p>

<p>The stock bought will, according to desire of the depositor
either be sent at his own risk and cost to the address he names
in his request or be taken care of without cost by the Office
under guarantee for kind and number of documents, class of
coupons and winning numbers in the lotteries, and the Post
Office Savings Bank will prepare and send to the depositor with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
reference to them a &laquo;stock account-book&raquo; (Document N<sup>o</sup> 32).</p>

<p>Stock which the depositor has not bought through the Post
Office Savings Bank can be deposited by means of a stock
account-book. The process is thus: the Post Office Savings
Bank buys the stock sent and enters it to the credit of the
sender, upon which the resale to him is gone through and the
stock entered in the usual way in the stocks account-book.</p>

<p>In such cases the purchase and sale in respect of stock of the
same kind takes place at the same market price, so that there
is no loss to the depositor, merely costing for the purchase on
account the fixed commission of 2 per thousand.</p>

<p>Depositors have, with a view to the taking over of such stock
to send it at their own cost to the Post Office Savings Bank,
joining with it a request in which the stock to be taken over is
described, the deposit-book being sent (either lottery or stock
account-book).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank undertakes to present at the
Treasury of the Public Debt, the bonds bought on account of
depositors in order that they may be stamped with the names
of the holders.</p>

<p>This can be done at the request of the purchaser immediately
after purchase of the bonds refered to in which case
the stamp duty will be accounted for at the same time as the
costs of purchase, or, the stamping of the bonds can be requested
which according to the stock account-book are already
in the Post Office Savings Bank. In the last case the duty
which including the cost of the form used amounts to 40 kreutzers
a stamp is to be forwarded in postage stamps enclosed
with form N<sup>o</sup> 22.</p>

<p>In every case the request must contain the exact name of
the holder and further information as to where he wishes to take
the interest, otherwise it will be understood that it is to be
received at the Public Debt Treasury.</p>

<p>After the stamping has occurred, which, according to rule
must take place within 3 or 4 weeks, the Post Office Savings
Banks forwards the stamped bonds to the address given before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the business was entered on. If an account of the interest due
has to be prepared it is forwarded to the holder by the Treasury
of the Public Debt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The coupons of the Bonds deposited as per stock account-book
will, when they fall due, be detached and cashed, and
upon the day of their falling due entered both in the stock
account-books of the holders without their having in each particular
case to give notice. With reference to these sums coupon-orders
will be issued to the depositor on the ground of which
they can receive payment of them at any Receiving Office, on
the amount being entered in their deposit-book before the
expiration of the two months during which the orders are valid.</p>

<p>After this the entry can only take place by sending the
deposit-book to the Post Office Savings Bank at Vienna.</p>

<p>It remains free to the holder of the stock-account book to
cause the Post Office Savings Bank to forward the coupons in
its case, falling due in their entirety or in part, either <i>in natura</i>
or in money to himself or to a third party. This order should
be sent to the Post Office Savings Bank in sufficient time for it
to arrive before the coupons fall due.</p>

<p>When the coupons are detached and sent <i>in natura</i>, no commission
is charged, only the persons to whom they to be
addressed must pay the postage as when coupon interests are
forwarded.</p>

<p>For banking coupons or lottery prizes, a commission will be
charged as for stock in case of the Post Office Savings Bank at
1 per thousand, excepting, however, when the produce of the
coupons is itself entered to the account of the depositor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The owner of a stock-account book can at any time request
that his stock in the public funds be sent to him or that it be sold.
The request is to be duly addressed to the Post Office Savings
Bank on form N<sup>o</sup> 22<sup>c</sup> in connection with N<sup>o</sup> 24. The request
forwarded to the Post Office Savings Bank must contain the
watchword and personal signature of the person making the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
request and be accompanied by the stock-account book and also
by the deposit-book when it is a question of entering the money
resulting from the sale to the credit of the depositor's account.</p>

<p>The sale takes place in agreement with the final state of the
market officially noted on the day the request arrived at the
Post Office Savings Bank upon a commission of 2 per 100, at
the lowest, 20 kreutzers.</p>

<p>If a stock-account book is lost, the loser is to inform the Post
Office Savings Bank in writing, sending at the same time his
watchword, and, enclosing 20 kreutzers in postage stamps
to request a duplicate.</p>

<p>If after eight days subsequent to the notice the stock-account
book is not found the Post Office Savings Bank will issue a
duplicate and send it to the depositor, or if an official act is
sought with reference to the book, the Post Office Savings Bank
will enter into communication with the actual possessor of the
book and it will depend upon the result whether the Post Office
Savings Bank can grant the request of the loser, or whether it
decides to relegate the parties to the magistrate in whose
jurisdiction the matter lies.</p>


<h4>11.&mdash;<i>Freedom from Cost of Postage and Commissions.</i></h4>

<p>The correspondence of depositors with Post Office Savings
Bank as well as with the Receiving Offices and with the Post
Office management is always post-free, even in the case of a
registered letter.</p>

<p>This favour however has no application to the sending of
certificates of stock or with reference to money transactions
which result from the purchase and collection of the interest on
the stock, nor does it apply to notices forwarded of their declared
value, with the sole exception of the deposit-book being sent
by letter with the declared value for the purchase of stock in the
funds.</p>

<p>The correspondence of the Post Office Savings Bank and its
organs with the depositors is with reference to orders to
addresses designated free from the tax of 1 kreutzer the letter, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
tax appointed with reference to the post offices not dependent
on the Treasury and to rural post offices, and in connection
with the collection of registered letters also to those dependent
on the Treasury.</p>

<p>The memorials addressed to the Post Office Savings Bank,
to the Post Office authorities and their organs by depositors
their legal successors, or authorised representatives, as well as
the acts of conveyance mentioned in article 6 of the law of
May 28<sup>th</sup> 1882 are stamp and duty free. The interests of the
savings deposits are in like manner exempt from the Income
Tax and from any future tax coming in its place.</p>

<p>The deposit-book as well as the forms necessary in giving
instructions in business transactions with the Post Office Saving
Bank will be supplied to depositors gratuitously.</p>


<h4>12.&mdash;<i>Official Secrets.</i></h4>

<p>The officials of the Post Office Savings Bank are bound by
duty to keep the business and official secrets and it is strictly
forbidden to them, beyond their superiors, to impart to any persons
whatever, knowledge of any kind relating either to the
names of depositors or the the amount of the sums deposited or
withdrawn, or to the amount of balances. Those who contravene
this rule will undergo disciplinary treatment, and, according
to the circumstances, will be dismissed from the service.</p>

<p>Every depositor may therefore rely on the strictest secrecy
with relation to his business transactions with the Post Office
Savings Bank, not only with reference to the usual Post Office
Savings Service, but also with regard to the business in the
Public Funds.</p>

The deposit-book is issued in the name of the person for whom the savings have
been deposited, and is to contain the notes necessary to the identification of the

</p>
<p>
A depositor who cannot write will have to bring with him a trustworthy man
who will have to attest the identity of the depositor and to sign the deposit-book
in his stead.
</p>
<p>
An assignment of a deposit-book to another person is only to be accepted by the
Post Office Savings Bank when the act of assignment has taken place at a post
office entrusted with Post Office Savings Bank business.
</p>
<p>
This being done, the assignee is to be regarded as the proprietor of the deposit-book.

<p>
Whoever causes two or more deposit-books to be issued loses the interests on the

<p>
If the whole amount of the deposits in the two or more deposit-books that a
depositor has caused to be issued is over the sum of a 1,000 florins, or if a depositor
has deposited in one year more than 300 florins, in the two or more deposit-books
issued to him, he will lose in the first case that part of the capital which exceeds
1,000 florins, and in the second, that part of the capital which exceeds
300 florins.
</p>
<p>
The Minister of Commerce is empowered for well considered reasons to be indulgent
with reference to the loss of capital, which, in conformity with the regulations,
would occur to the surplus deposits.

<p>
The repayment of sums between 10 and 100 florins will be made in a fortnight at

<p>
<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>The proposed law laid before the Chamber of Representatives,
proposes to attach to our General Savings Bank, a
service of which the great importance, the remarkable stability
and singular capacity for development, has been proved by a
trial conducted with vigilant carefulness during thirteen years
in Austria and five in Hungary. In fact the chief part of the
unfolding of a project of this kind consists in the setting forth
of the results of foreign experience.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(This part of the explanation relating to Austrian experience
is a summary of the preceding article, to which we refer our
readers.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Returning now to Belgium we cannot fail to recognise first
of all that the institution of the General Savings Bank by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Act of March 16<sup>th</sup> 1865, is one of the important events of our
economic evolution. History will justly connect the name of
Fr&egrave;re-Orban with a work so perfectly balanced and bearing
the imprint of a real constructive genius.</p>

<p>The solution given to the fundamental problem of the relations
of the Savings Bank with the State, and of which the
essential characteristics were:&mdash;making the Central Bank a
distinct legal entity, whilst at the same time surrounding it
with the guarantee of the State;&mdash;taking measures so that this
State guarantee should not be to onerous,&mdash;and the constitution
of a reserve fund,&mdash;the conception of the complex and
diversified system of investing the capital in the best way to
suit both the exigencies of its productivity and its disposal;&mdash;fixing
the rates of interest and the periodic distribution of a
portion of the reserve;&mdash;the accession of all classes of society
to the Savings Bank and the admission of unlimited deposits;&mdash;the
correctives brought to bear on these principles by the
fixing of differential rates of interest according to the largeness
of the deposits;&mdash;all these elements wisely co-ordinated, give
to the work of the legislator of 1865, at once an original
physiognomy and a true grandeur.</p>

<p>No one of the fundamental ideas of this edifice is attacked by
the bill laid before the Chamber.</p>

<p>But this work is perfectible and it contains in its constitution
even the principles of its perfectibility. In studying the functions
of the Savings Bank, the conviction is soon arrived at
that the authors of the Act of 1865, conceived them in the
most general and simple form possible, leaving it to time to
complete their work. Thus it is that the investments are
above all things regarded and portioned out with the view of
the possible eventual withdrawal of deposits.</p>

<p>The great peril which the makers of the law had before them,
was that of not being able to satisfy a sudden and simultaneous
demand for the repayment of the deposits. As to the various
forms which these investments could take, they were thoroughly
recognized and pointed out by the law-makers, but there were
some which were only mentioned in their explanatory state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>ment,
but which must take a more and more important position.</p>

<p>This has occurred with regard to agricultural investments,
which have awaited a complementary organic legislation. This
again is the case with the investments in land, the importance
of which in the economy of the Savings Bank, Fr&egrave;re-Orban
had seen already in 1850, better than anyone, but which so far
has lacked appropriate embodiment by which to give a real
satisfaction to the needs of rural property.</p>

<p>The Acts of April 15<sup>th</sup> 1884 and June 21<sup>st</sup> 1894, with regard
to agricultural credit, of August 9<sup>th</sup> 1889, with regard to
working-class Dwellings, the bill of November 19<sup>th</sup> 1896, with
regarded to landed credit only develop the thought contained
in the institution of 1865.</p>

<p>The much-regretted Mahillon has profoundly said:</p>

<p>&laquo;It is indispensable in order to produce its whole useful
effect, that the Savings Bank should be completed by distinct
bodies which regulate its working. It is by this organic
development that the fruitful character of the genius of our
legislators will show itself.&raquo;</p>

<p>Our bill tends less to give a larger expansion to these
original functions of the Savings Bank than to set free a new
function which will carry we think according to the words of
Mahillon, its useful effect to a still higher degree.</p>

<p>The Act of 1865 makes no preparation for this putting into
motion the property of the depositors, but then neither its text,
nor the spirit even of the institution excludes it. It has been
seen at work in the examples of Austria and Hungary; such
important innovations however require in themselves real legal
sanction.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the two large classes of operations which the
new service proposes to combine, imply the possibility for
third parties to effect at all post offices payments in favour of
depositors whose deposit-books will be kept centralized at the
General Savings Bank.</p>

<p>To-day the deposits, like the withdrawals, although they can
be effected at all the post offices, can only be so effected on
presentation of the Savings Account-book, whether this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
done by the holders themselves or by third parties in their
names. The Annual Report of the Savings Bank on these
operations gives the statistics of deposits effected by teachers
on behalf of their pupils, by parents on behalf of their children,
by masters on behalf of their workmen. Teachers, parents,
workers, retain the account-books.</p>

<p>According to the proposed law depositors will be able to
dispose of the free balance of their account by payment-cheques
or clearing-cheques.</p>

<p>At present the holders of the account books cannot have
recourse to the cheque, nor transfer any sum from their
account to that of another on a simple demand addressed to the
Savings Bank. Every transfer resolves itself into an act of
cession which must be signified to the Bank by a judicial act
or notified by a letter bearing the legalised signature of the
ceder. The carrying out of these extra judicial formalities is
evidently incompatible with what is required in a perfect
organ of circulation.</p>

<p>The end in view is in fact to place at the disposition of the
greatest number of depositors a permanent intermediary which
will enable them to economise time to the utmost, to reduce
risk and expense and to save money.</p>

<p>The postal administration by the extraordinary development
of its invaluable public service in collecting bills and taking
receipts, the importance of which has tripled in the last fifteen
years, and by the aid which it has given to the Savings Bank in
virtue of the Act of May 30<sup>th</sup> 1879, in the collection of deposits
and in payment of withdrawals, has realized one part of the
operations which the projected institution includes.</p>

<p>But it is necessary to attain a still higher degree of organisation
taking the Savings Bank itself as the foundation on which
to rest.</p>

<p>The point aimed at is how to place at the disposal of its
depositors a regular and continuous service of account-keeping
both individual and collective in character, and to co-ordinate
in a permanent manner all the operations which it embraces;
the point aimed at is how to assure to every depositor the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
power of causing regular collections to be made by the mediation
of the Savings Bank and the post offices, the amount being
carried to his or her account; the point aimed at, is how to
effect these payments by the same intermediaries without
running the slightest risk, without the least of these operations
escaping an inflexible account-keeping, constantly kept before
the depositor's eyes, and without there being any need for the
depositors themselves directly and personally to handle the
funds.</p>

<p>The centralization of the accounts of all the adherents makes
it possible for the Savings Bank to obtain clear and definite
results and to eliminate by means of the clearing of accounts
the intermediary of money in an ever increasing number of
transactions, for this service is by its natural evolution, by the
rapid increase of the number of the adherents destined to
preponderate.</p>

<p>Assuredly, the instruments of credit and of liquidation, of
clearing and balancing, which more and more reduce the use
of money, have in Belgium taken an already great importance
at the National Bank, in the private banks, and in the Unions
de Credit:&mdash;the credit given and received having, in a quarter
of a century attained two thousand millions of francs at the
National Bank alone;&mdash;the extent of the movement being
shown by the large figures of the current accounts upon which
it operates, and during the last three years the National Bank
has sought to connect by a sort of clearing the other credit
institutions.</p>

<p>But who can hide the fact that we have yet much progress
to make, or how far we are behind certain nations such as
England. We may judge of it by the collected statistics given
very lately by M. Des Essarts in the Annals of the Statistical
Society of Paris. The point to aim at is to make the more
perfect means of liquidation penetrate more thoroughly into
new soil and of bringing them into closer connection with the
social organism. This is precisely the project now laid before
the Chamber, by which it is proposed for this end to have
recourse to an institution like the Savings Bank, the deposits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in which rise to more than 450 millions of francs and are distributed
in more than 1 million 100,000 bankbooks, and which
has seen these deposits increase, in five years, more than
100 millions; and to bring this institution to help to accelerate
the general evolution of the community in the fruitful direction
of the gradual economising of the monetary instrument and its
final elimination.</p>

<p>In looking into the official statistics we become convinced
that the one most fixed idea of Fr&egrave;re-Orban is there definitely
brought into operation; that of the common participation of all
classes of society in the Savings Bank.</p>

<p>Out of 100,000 savings-books, if 50% be set on one side as
children's books, it will be seen that the surplus may be divided
into nearly equal proportions between the class of manual
workers on the one hand, and on the other that of the shopkeepers,
the heads of industrial or agricultural enterprises,
officials military men, proprietors, stock holders and professional
persons. If to this division according to the number
of account-books be added, the classification of the account-books
according to their total sum, the conviction is soon
arrived at that it is to the members of the working-classes
that the cheques and the clearing of cheques will directly
render the least service. In effect, if one ought to attribute to
the working-class all the account-books of 1 to 1,000 francs,
their total importance would represent hardly a quarter of the
sum total of the account-books of the Savings Bank. This
point will be rendered more clear by the publication of the book
of Messrs Hamande and Burny.</p>

<p>However, if putting the consideration of individuals on one
side we consider the different forms of working class associations,
the conviction is arrived at that, in the service of cheques
and clearing they will have a valuable intermediary: the mutual
aid societies, the cooperative societies, the professional unions
themselves will find in this organ of circulation, the same help
as the multitudinous associations of every kind connected with
the Savings Bank of Vienna, the popular banks and the rural
Savings Banks, specially carried on with a view to small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
industrial agricultural and commercial enterprises, and in a
higher degree the unions de credit, will connect themselves by
organic threads to the service of the Savings Bank; they will
find in it a means of bringing their efforts to a common point.</p>

<p>It may be added that, to the leading idea of the monetary
benefit, is, in our idea united that, of assuring to the workers
in this great movement of association one of the indispensable
organs to a general and truly democratic financial service and
a powerful instrument of economic education, for it will accustom
the working-class societies which connect themselves with
it to the invaluable discipline of a strict and permanent bookkeeping.</p>

<p>The articles of the proposed law only reproduce the general
conditions of this new institution as they result from experience.</p>

<p>The cheques and clearing service ought to have a distinct
existence, its accounts being kept separate from those of the
savings service, understanding the term savings in the sense
which the law of 1865 has given to it.</p>

<p>The Austrian law of November 19<sup>th</sup> 1887, the complement of
the law of May 28<sup>th</sup> 1882, has laid this down. This condition
is bound up with the liberty and spontaneity which ought to
characterise the association; nothing can oblige the depositors
in the Savings Bank to give their adhesion to this service, to
run the risks, small though they be, of these operations, to
submit to the working out of its special conditions. Its utility
ought to be freely appreciated and the Savings Bank will on
the other hand have to fix the regulations which the adherents
must satisfy.</p>

<p>Thus those affiliated to the service will not be necessarily
confounded with the whole mass of the depositors in the
Savings Bank. In carrying out this law it will be necessary to
fix a minimum deposit enabling anyone to become a participant
in the institution and to have an account; and until the withdrawal
of the depositor he will not be able to dispose of this
sum; this is the fundamental guarantee the Austrian law imposes
and it is a legitimate one: the risks are in other respects
insignificant; however it is wise to render this guarantee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
complete by the formation of a reserve fund; all those who
adhere to the service will participate in it; the mode of its
formation, and the amount will be fixed by subsequent ordinances.
Thus the stability of the institution will be completely
assured. Free to adhere to the service, the depositor ought
to be free to withdraw from it, only the regulations will have if
this occurs, to determine the consequences of withdrawal, from
the point of view of responsibility.</p>

<p>The working of the system absolutely requires the complete
centralisation of the accounts of the adherents.</p>

<p>The account-books ought to be preserved as well as the
accounts kept at the central office of the Savings Bank. What
enlargement will be required in number of persons employed
must be left to the future. This centralisation is the absolute
condition of the regularity of the entries, the certainty of the
control and of the preservation against error and fraud; without
it the transferring of the entries and of the clearing could not be
carried out; by it alone the exact state of the balance of every
adherent can be known at any moment; by it alone exact information
can be had at each operation of the situation and consequently
of the extent of the capital which can be disposed of.
The secret of the way in which the surplus is employed will
moreover be kept from the knowledge of outsiders.</p>

<p>Experience has proved that the central service of bookkeeping
can, without any disturbance, be placed every day in
relation with all the post-offices, and the accounts be kept to
date notwithstanding the apparent inextricable complexity of
all this correspondence and of all these various operations.</p>

<p>The instruments intended to facilitate the two classes of
operations in which the Savings Bank and the Postal administration
will intervene in the interest of the adherents:&mdash;the
collection on behalf of the latter, the payments in or the payments
in discharge are the object of special bye-laws. In this
direction still, and in this direction especially we shall be able
to learn from experience. Perfected instruments, as the
<i>Empfang Erlag Schein</i>, the certificate of payment in and of
deposit, the cheque-books of payment and of clearing with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
ingenious measures taken to baffle every fraud have been well
tried in Austria and Hungary and there would be no longer any
peril in adopting them.</p>

<p>A metallic reserve sufficient to satisfy all immediate wants
ought to be secured. Experience has proved that this condition
is to be realized without difficulty.</p>

<p>The establishment of a service of cheques and clearing may
lead to a more considerable flow of capital to the Savings Bank.</p>

<p>This has been the result in Vienna and has been in fact the
very thing the Viennese legislation wished to bring about.
But, on the one hand the investments continue without ceasing
to increase: for example, the extent of the advances connected
with agriculture and land which will be solicited of the Savings
Bank or in which it will participate cannot be measured; on the
other hand it is possible to exercise regulative and limiting
action on the deposits in making a difference in the rates of
interest given to depositors; it is possible to go the length of
suppressing all interest; to this end special arrangements with
reference to deposits belonging to the cheque and clearing service
will be made in carrying out the law.</p>

<p>Such is the economy of a proposition in itself modest and
simple, which we have no hesitation to submit to the Chamber.
If we make an effort to conceive what in the future will be the
evolution of an apparatus so marvellously flexible as the
Savings Bank, we may fairly expect from a combination of the
service of cheques and clearing with that of investments, of the
association of special organs,&mdash;such as Mahillon speaks of,&mdash;with
the central organism of the Bank, a powerful co-operation
in the legitimate effort to eliminate metallic money from our
circulating system. But without inquiring, now, what may
occur in a future perhaps alas still remote, in only occupying
ourselves with the production of present good, it has seemed
to us in the general interest to solicit the Chamber to establish
a service of which decisive experiences have fixed the essential
conditions and shown the efficacy, and of which the link is as
manifest with our democratic evolution as with the higher forms
of credit and circulation.</p>
